LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is expected to attend a global summit on artificial intelligence in Britain this week, according to a government official.

Britain is bringing together representatives of AI companies, political leaders and experts on Nov. 1-2 to discuss what some see as the risks posed by AI, with an aim of building an international consensus on its safe development.

Around 100 participants will discuss subjects including the unpredictable advances of AI and the potential for humans to lose control of it, according to the agenda.

While several world leaders, including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen are due to attend the summit, the full guest list has not been made public.

"In conversation with @elonmusk after the AI Safety Summit Thursday night on @X," British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Musk's social media platform X.

Sunak's Downing Street office declined to comment.

LONDON — Tech tycoon Elon Musk will attend the U.K.’s artificial intelligence summit this week, Rishi Sunak has confirmed.

A U.K. official familiar with summit planning said the X and Tesla boss is expected to attend both days, as well as a separate reception on Thursday after the summit.

Musk will take part in a conversation with the U.K. prime minister “after the AI summit,” according to a message posted on Sunak’s official X, formerly Twitter, account on Monday evening.

The AI summit — which will focus on risks and mitigations for the cutting-edge tech — is set to take place on Wednesday and Thursday at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire.

Attendees for the gathering are being closely watched. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and U.S. President Biden won’t be attending but are sending delegates. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni are confirmed.

Musk has previously urged caution over AI, signing a letter warning “AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity.”

The U.K. kicks off its landmark artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday, with political leaders and bosses of top AI firms gathering to hash out international agreement on how to address safe and responsible development of the rapidly advancing technology. The two-day summit, which takes place on Nov. 1-2 at Bletchley Park, the iconic home of Britain's World War II codebreakers, hosts government officials and companies from around the world, including the U.S. and China, two superpowers in the race to develop cutting-edge AI technologies. It is Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's chance to make a statement to the world on the U.K.'s role in the global conversation surrounding AI, and how the technology should be regulated. Ever since the introduction of Microsoft -backed OpenAI's ChatGPT, the race toward the regulation of AI globally has intensified.

Here's who's going

Major names in the technology and political world will be there. They range from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose private jet landed in the U.K. late Tuesday, to U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. Musk is attending on behalf of his AI startup xAI. You can watch the biggest talks and speeches from the summit live here.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz When asked whether Sunak feels snubbed by his international counterparts, his spokesperson told reporters Monday, "No, not at all."

What the summit seeks to address

The main objective of the U.K. AI summit is to find some level of international coordination when it comes to agreeing some principles on the ethical and responsible development of AI models. The summit is squarely focused on so-called "frontier AI" models — in other words, the advanced large language models, or LLMs, like those developed by companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere. It will look to address two key categories of risk when it comes to AI: misuse and loss of control. Misuse risks involve a bad actor being aided by new AI capabilities. For example, a cybercriminal could use AI to develop a new type of malware that cannot be detected by security researchers, or be used to help state actors develop dangerous bioweapons. Loss of control risks refer to a situation in which the AI that humans create could be turned against them. This could "emerge from advanced systems that we would seek to be aligned with our values and intentions," the government said.

Will it succeed?

Sunak is walking a tightrope, as he seeks to boost investment from large tech firms in the U.K., while also convincing civil society groups that he is paying enough attention to the labor displacement risks posed by AI. Of particular concern is the potential for the technology to replace — or undermine — human intelligence. Ahead of the summit, more than 100 organizations, including the Trades Union Congress, Connected by Data and Open Rights Group signed a letter to the PM warning that the summit is a "closed door event" that is dominated by Big Tech firms and has "squeezed out" small businesses and artists.

Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover, the platform and its cultural impact have fundamentally changed
********
New York CNN —

It’s been one year to the day since Elon Musk completed his purchase of Twitter for $44 billion and set the company, along with its employees and users, off on a whiplash-inducing series of twists and turns.

Twelve months on, the company barely resembles its former self — and not only because Musk renamed it “X” and did away with its iconic blue bird branding. Through a dizzying and haphazard barrage of changes, Musk has transformed a profitable company once regarded as the world’s go-to source for breaking news and political commentary into a widely ridiculed platform that’s fighting just to break even and crippled by debt; that’s struggling to manage spam and disinformation; that’s alienated some of its biggest advertisers and users; and that’s casting about for purpose.

Even as Musk — and new CEO Linda Yaccarino — push their vision for X as an “everything app,” the company has seemingly no clear path back to prominence or respectability, or to recouping Musk’s massive investment.

Driving the transformation has been a relentless stream of layoffs, resignations and policy reversals, as well as messy product rollouts and unfulfilled promises. The company faces a series of legal challenges brought by everyone from former employees to company contractors and landlords that have further complicated its outlook. X is also the subject of multiple regulatory investigations by the US Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and EU officials that could potentially lead to penalties, both for the company as well as Musk himself.

X claims engagement is up, but the company appears to use different metrics than it did prior to the Musk takeover, making a true comparison difficult. Visits to the company’s website are down 14% compared to last September, far outstripping the 3.7% decline industrywide over the same period, according to a report this month by the internet monitoring firm Similarweb.

Yaccarino said in a statement Thursday that she is “incredibly proud of the work our team has been doing to accelerate the future of X.” The X CEO highlighted some of the new products and features launched over the past year, including the ability for companies to post job listings, longer posts, and audio and video calls for Premium users, which rolled out this week. She said that X is “a place where everyone can freely express themselves, so long as they do so within the bounds of the law,” and added that safety remains a “critical priority” for the platform.

“If we can achieve all of this in just 12 months, just imagine the scope of our ambition for next year,” Yaccarino said.

X is now facing perhaps its biggest test yet under new ownership amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war — and numerous tech watchdogs and civil society groups have raised alarms about false claims and propaganda linked to the conflict on the platform. And as next year’s elections in the United States and elsewhere raise fears about the further spread of misinformation campaigns, X’s value to the public conversation appears increasingly in doubt.

All of this unfolded over the course of just 365 days. But for many, likely including beleaguered users who have decamped for alternatives such as Threads, Mastodon and BlueSky, it’s felt more like a decade. Here’s a (non-exhaustive) account of how Musk has fundamentally changed Twitter since he made one of the most consequential acquisitions of the social media age.

Heads rolling

In a series of rolling layoffs in the months after his takeover, Musk axed what he would later describe as roughly 80% of the company’s headcount.

Few departments were left untouched by the layoffs. They affected positions in some of the company’s most critical areas: policy, trust and safety, communications, ethical AI, search and more. The result was a hollowed-out workforce charged with maintaining rickety systems that had already been described as brittle, and which Musk further shrunk in an effort to cut costs. Under Musk, the company’s technical infrastructure proved increasingly prone to meltdowns, resulting in a series of glitches earlier this year affecting users’ ability to use the site.

Along the way, Musk fired — or accepted the resignations of — key members of Twitter’s old guard, including its former CEO and CFO, as well as its general counsel, policy chief, chief privacy officer, chief information security officer, director of product management and head of trust and safety. Even some of the people who rose to become Musk’s trusted lieutenants at the company have already left.

The workforce cuts have prompted repeated questions, including from US lawmakers and regulators, about the platform’s ability to respond to threats to security and privacy, along with elections, misinformation and hate speech. And thousands of former employees have accused Musk of providing fewer severance benefits than they were promised, and some also allege he’s delayed severance benefits and payments to cover executives’ work-related legal fees.

Product and policy overhauls

In his zeal to restore what he describes as “free speech” to X, Musk has made numerous policy and product decisions that have altered what users can see on the platform.

He reversed Twitter’s ban on former President Donald Trump based on an unscientific poll of his followers, after previously saying the decision would be up to a “content moderation council” that never materialized. He also reinstated the suspended accounts of white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. He temporarily suspended several journalists from Twitter for their reports on a third-party account devoted to tracking Musk’s private jet (despite previously criticizing the platform’s suspension practices).

Under Musk’s leadership, the company removed specific protections for transgender people from Twitter’s hateful conduct policy. X made it easier for politicians and political candidates to qualify for newsworthiness exemptions from Twitter’s rules, when they would otherwise have their content restricted or removed. The platform overturned a 2019-era ban on political and issue advertising, and issued an updated, “zero-tolerance” policy on violent speech that was nevertheless vaguer and more subjective than what it replaced. And it updated Twitter’s privacy policies to say the company may allow users to opt-in to having their biometric information and job and education history collected by the platform.

But perhaps no change has been as significant as Musk’s move to replace Twitter’s legacy verification (“blue check”) badges with a new form of verification that no longer carries the explicit assurance of authenticity.

Days after his takeover, Musk debuted — then un-debuted, and later revived — a subscription feature that granted any user a blue verification badge if they paid for the platform’s $8 per month subscription plan. Critics warned that the system would lead to impersonation on a massive scale, and undermine a feature that once helped users to trust what they saw on the platform.

Sure enough, when the feature was first launched, Twitter faced a wave of verified impostors pretending to be everyone from Nintendo to LeBron James. After the platform revoked the badges of accounts who’d been verified under the old system, Musk offered to personally pay for verification for James and several other frustrated, high-profile users.

Under the new system, users who paid for verification have their posts boosted by the platform’s algorithm. And more recently, X rolled out an advertising revenue share program for verified users, rewarding those that drive engagement with payouts — creating potential financial incentives for engagement farmers and misinformation peddlers who share inflammatory or misleading claims.

As it dismantles old ways of thinking about content moderation, X leaders have repeatedly touted “Community Notes,” an expanded version of the “Birdwatch” user-generated moderation system that Twitter launched in 2021. X said this week that Community Notes now has more than 100,000 volunteer user-moderators in 44 countries who are participating in adding contextual labels to content on the platform.

But numerous reports have suggested that Community Notes is struggling to meet its mission, burdened by issues like delays in users adding labels and bad actors attempting to game the system. (Yaccarino said in Thursday’s statement that Community Notes are getting faster, and that “this product is not perfect, but it is improving rapidly.”)

In the meantime, Musk has also antagonized and pushed away many journalists who previously contributed to the spread of reliable information on the platform. Most notably, NPR and PBS abandoned the platform entirely in April after X labeled them as “state-affiliated media,” a designation the broadcasters said misleadingly implied they receive substantial backing from government entities or are not editorially independent. The platform later changed the label to “government-affiliated media” and then did away with it altogether, but the outlets have not returned.

Many of Musk’s content and product decisions have also led to what civil society groups have reported as a troubling spread of hateful speech on the platform.

Sluggish business

In the early days of Musk’s takeover, many of Twitter’s largest advertisers — including the likes of General Mills and the Volkswagen Group — paused their spending over concerns about X’s layoffs, content moderation capabilities and general uncertainty about the platform’s future.

The mass advertiser pullback tanked the company’s revenue, and it still has yet to fully recover. Musk has lashed out over the brand revolt, accusing his critics of deliberate sabotage and even going so far as to sue one watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, and threatening to sue the Anti-Defamation League, alleging they damaged the brand with claims about surging hate speech on X.

For its part, X has claimed hate speech is down and has touted new brand safety controls that purport to allow advertisers to restrict what kinds of content their ads can run next to. But even those safety offerings appeared to run into some early road bumps.

The company’s leaders have offered conflicting views on the state of its finances — making it unclear when and if X’s business can be revived.

Musk said in July that the company remained cash flow negative because of a 50% decline in ad revenue and heavy debt load. A month later, Yaccarino said many top advertisers had returned and the company was “close to breakeven.” The next month, Musk said US advertising revenue was “still down 60%.” Weeks later, Yaccarino said the company could return to profitability early next year.

Meanwhile, the banks that lent to Musk to finance his takeover are still struggling to offload the debt due in part to the billionaire’s chaotic leadership, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.

Yaccarino’s ascension to CEO in June signaled Musk’s commitment to winning back advertisers; her track record as an NBCU ad executive, along with the cheery persona she projected on X, seemed to foretell a brighter future for the company. But as Musk has continued to make off-hand announcements about the company’s roadmap, at times seemingly taking Yaccarino by surprise, outsiders have widely wondered about the true extent of Yaccarino’s authority and influence within the company.

In an interview last month, Yaccarino stressed that she does have autonomy from Musk as CEO. “Elon works on the technology and dreams up what’s next,” she said. “I bring it to market.”

Musk’s erratic behavior

Through it all, Musk has become the platform’s most consistent main character, weighing in on the largest issues of the day whether he is informed about them or not. When Paul Pelosi was brutally attacked in his own home, Musk baselessly amplified fringe conspiracy theories about the assault. He recommended that X users monitor the Israel-Hamas conflict by following an account known for spreading disinformation, before later deleting his post. He has obliquely defended “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams over racist comments and has condemned the financier George Soros, a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories.

Musk appears to harbor an obsession with his own popularity on the platform, reportedly pressuring engineers to boost his own posts in users’ feeds after complaining his posts got fewer views than President Joe Biden’s during the Super Bowl.

In other contexts, Musk has leveraged his ownership of Twitter to promote politicians he personally favors, such as by helping to launch Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign by way of a live Spaces event plagued by technical glitches. A week after that event, Musk held another Spaces event to promote Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the vaccine skeptic and another presidential hopeful, and he promoted an interview between former Fox host Tucker Carlson and another republican contender, Vivek Ramaswamy. He has also hosted Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative Israeli prime minister for a live discussion on X. Musk has said he’s willing to host candidates from across the ideological spectrum, but so far few if any politicians whom Musk disagrees with have been promoted in similar events.

And, in an attempt to prove that former Twitter executives deliberately discriminated against conservatives on the platform, Musk provided a handpicked group of journalists with selective access to company records. The resulting reports, known as The Twitter Files, purported to reveal a nefarious campaign of suppression. However, the internal communications actually corroborated existing accounts of how Twitter struggled to handle a 2020 New York Post article involving Hunter Biden and his laptop. Musk’s own lawyers later would go on to dispute the insinuations and allegations in The Twitter Files as they tried to prevent Trump from pursuing a case against the company in court.

Musk has also used the platform to promote his other companies and to hit back at his detractors — everyone from former employees to various regulatory bodies scrutinizing his ownership of the platform.

It is perhaps Musk’s all-consuming presence that has most undermined what users used to love about Twitter. The platform was once a place to hear from lots of different kinds of voices; where any given user might be leading the day’s “discourse” with the newsiest, most entertaining or controversial bit of content; where there was indeed sometimes toxicity, but it was generally overpowered by useful, up-to-the-minute news and commentary. Now, it’s the Musk show, and users increasingly seem inclined to tune out.

How Elon Musk Changed the Meaning of Twitter for Users
********
After Nicholas Campiz evacuated from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, in February 2022, he stayed glued to Twitter. As battles raged across the country, he tracked them on the app, staying up through many nights in a hotel room in Tbilisi, Georgia, to read updates as they rolled in, one tweet at a time.

“As more Ukrainians hopped onto Twitter to tell their story, you had a lot of good accounts from them,” Mr. Campiz said.

When war broke out this month in Israel and Gaza, Mr. Campiz, 40, a cartographer who now lives in Florida, turned to Twitter again. But his timeline on the app, which has been renamed X, was filled with posts from accounts he didn’t recognize and content that had been debunked, he said.

With the war in Ukraine, “Twitter was invaluable because you were able to get connected to accounts that were providing good information,” he said. “I feel really helpless in this Israel-Gaza thing because on Twitter now, the ability to do that is just gone.”

One Year After Elon Musk Bought Twitter, His Hilarious Nightmare Continues

After Elon Musk finalized his purchase of Twitter on October 27, 2022, I wrote an article in which I warned, “We need to take seriously the possibility that this will end up being one of the funniest things that’s ever happened.”

Today, I have to issue an apology: I was wrong. Musk’s ownership of Twitter may well be — at least for people who manage to enjoy catastrophic human folly — the funniest thing that’s ever happened.

Let’s take a look back and see how I was so mistaken.

Musk began his tenure as Twitter’s owner by posting this message to the company’s advertisers, in which he said, “Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise. … Twitter obviously cannot be a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all.”

Dear Twitter Advertisers pic.twitter.com/GMwHmInPAS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2022

Musk had to say this for obvious reasons: 90 percent of Twitter’s revenues came from ads, and corporate America gets nervous about its ads appearing in an environment that’s completely unpredictable.

I assumed that Musk would make a serious effort here. But this was based on my belief that, while he might be a deeply sincere ultra-right-wing crank, he surely had the level of self-control possessed by a 6-year-old. He does not. Big corporations now comprehend this and are understandably anxious about advertising with a company run by a man who, at any moment, may see user @JGoebbels1488 posting excerpts from “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” and reply “concerning!”

The consequences of this have been what you’d expect. The marketing consultancy Ebiquity represents 70 of the 100 companies that spend the most on ads, including Google and General Motors. Before Musk’s takeover, 31 of their big clients bought space on Twitter. Last month, just two did. Ebiquity’s chief strategy officer told Business Insider that “this is a drop we have not seen before for any major advertising platform.”

This is why Twitter users now largely see ads from micro-entrepreneurs who are, say, selling 1/100th scale papier-mâché models of the Eiffel Tower. The good news for Twitter is that such companies don’t worry much about brand safety. But the bad news is that their annual advertising budget is $25. Hence, Twitter’s advertising revenue in the U.S. is apparently down 60 percent year over year.

I also never imagined it possible that Musk would rename Twitter — which had become an incredibly well-known brand — to “X” just because he’s been obsessed with the idea of a company with that name since he was a kid. It’s as though he bought Coca-Cola and changed its name to that of his beloved childhood pet tortoise Zoinks. The people who try to measure this kind of thing claim that this has destroyed between $4 and $20 billion of Twitter’s value. (As you see in this article, I refuse to refer to Twitter as X just out of pure orneriness.)

Another of my mistaken beliefs was that Musk understood the basic facts about Twitter. The numbers have gone down somewhat since Musk’s purchase of the company, but right now, about 500 million people log on to Twitter at least once a month. Perhaps 120 million check it out daily; these average users spend about 15 minutes on it. A tenth of these numbers — that is, about 12 million people — are heavy users, who account for 70 percent of all the time spent by anyone on the app.

Musk is one of these heavy users. He adores Twitter, as do some other troubled souls. But this led him to wildly overestimate its popularity among normal humans. A company with 50 million fanatically devoted users could possibly survive a collapse in ad revenue by enticing them to pay a subscription fee. But Twitter does not have such users and now never will, given Musk’s relentless antagonizing of the largely progressive Twitterati.

So how much is Twitter worth today? When Musk became involved with the company in the first months of 2022, its market capitalization was about $28 billion. He then offered to pay $44 billion for it, which was so much more than the company was worth that its executives had to accept the offer or they would have been sued by their shareholders. Now that the company’s no longer publicly traded — and so its basic financials don’t have to be disclosed — it’s more difficult to know what’s going on. However, Fidelity Investments, a financial services company, holds a stake in Twitter and has marked down its valuation of this stake by about two-thirds since Musk bought it. This implies that Twitter is now worth around $15 billion.

The significance of this is that Musk and his co-investors only put up $31 billion or so of the $44 billion purchase price. The remaining $13 billion was borrowed by Twitter at high interest rates from Wall Street. In other words, Musk and company are perilously close to having lost their entire $31 billion.

In the end, I did not understand Musk’s determination to torment himself by forcing his entire existence into an extremely painful Procrustean bed. The results have been bleak and awful for Twitter and the world, but not just bleak and awful: They have also been hilarious. Anyone who likes to laugh about human vanity and hubris has to appreciate his commitment to the bit.

Musk says Starlink will provide Gaza connectivity for aid groups

JERUSALEM, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Saturday that SpaceX's Starlink will support communication links in Gaza with "internationally recognized aid organizations", prompting Israel's communication minister to say Israel would fight the move.

Musk said in a post on social media platform X that it was not clear who has authority for ground links in Gaza, but we do know that "no terminal has requested a connection in that area".

A telephone and internet blackout isolated people in the Gaza Strip from the world and from each other on Saturday, with calls to loved ones, ambulances or colleagues elsewhere all but impossible as Israel widened its air and ground assault.

International humanitarian organizations said the blackout, which began late on Friday, was worsening an already desperate situation by impeding life-saving operations and preventing contact with their staff on the ground.

SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on how it would ensure any Starlink connection was used by aid organizations and not by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip.

Responding to Musk's post on X, Israel's communication minister Shlomo Karhi said Israel "will use all means at its disposal to fight this."

"HAMAS will use it for terrorist activities," Karhi wrote. "Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people. All of them! By then, my office will cut any ties with starlink."

Following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Starlink satellites were reported to have been critical to maintaining internet connectivity in some areas despite attempted Russian jamming.

Since then, Musk has said he declined to extend coverage over Russian-occupied Crimea, refusing to allow his satellites to be used for Ukrainian attacks on Russian forces there.

Elon Musk wants your 'entire financial life' on X: Report
********
Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly Twitter, attends a U.S. Senate bipartisan Artificial Intelligence (AI) Insight Forum at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 13, 2023.

X owner Elon Musk is attempting to create a future in which X users can use the platform for their entire financial lives, according to a report from The Verge.

Musk told employees in a meeting Thursday that the plan is to roll out the feature in 2024, said The Verge's report, which also quoted CEO Linda Yaccarino as saying that it is a "full opportunity" in the next calendar year.

"When I say payments, I actually mean someone's entire financial life," Musk said in the meeting, according to The Verge's article, citing audio it obtained. "If it involves money. It'll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it's not just like send $20 to my friend. I'm talking about, like, you won't need a bank account."

X is working on securing money transmission licenses across the U.S., The Verge reported. The company already has licenses for money transmission or money services in nine states, according to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System.

Musk's desire to expand X's financial component falls in line with his previously laid-out ambition to make X "the everything app," announced when he rebranded the platform in July.

Elon Musk's estimated net worth dips below $200 billion again after low Tesla earnings
********
Elon Musk's net worth dropped by billions of dollars this week – dropping to $193 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. This is the first time since June that the Tesla CEO saw his net worth dip below $200 billion. But after Tesla reported low quarterly earnings, Musk – who owns about 13% of the car company – took a hit.

Bloomberg estimates Musk has lost $41 billion since Tesla's Oct. 18 earnings call. The financial publication says his net worth was $234 billion before Tesla announced its disappointing performance.

Forbes puts his net worth slightly higher, at $213.8 billion, but still says he recently lost about $1 billion. Still, as of Oct. 31, both publications say he is the richest person in the world.

Net worth is an estimate based on the assets a person owns. Musk notably gained a high-profile asset last year: Twitter. But a person's net worth fluctuates alongside the performance of companies.

Musk, who founded SpaceX and the Boring Company in addition to Tesla, has stakes in these companies, which contribute to his worth.

He bought Twitter, which he has renamed X, in April 2022 for $44 billion after saying he owned a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover, Forbes reports.

The Twitter deal officially went through in October 2022 and Musk now owns 74% of the company.

In November, his net worth dropped to an estimated $195.6 billion – hitting its lowest point in 2022, according to Forbes. It had previously seen a large dip in October 2021, when it dropped below $200 billion.

The dip in November set a record for the largest loss of personal fortune in history, according to Guinness World Records. Musk reported lost about $182 billion of his net worth since November 2021, according to Guinness, which cited Forbes. Some estimate he lost up to $200 billion, Guinness said at the time.

The 2022 dip was also attributed to poor performance of Tesla stock, which plummeted 65% in 2022, according to Guinness.

Musk's acquisition of Twitter also cost him a pretty penny. He sold nearly 8 million Tesla shares – worth $7 billion – in August 2022 as a legal battle with Twitter loomed. After Musk tried to back out, Twitter sued him to enforce the rules of their acquisition agreement and countersued.

This dip put him at the No. 2 spot on Forbes' Real Time Billionaires list. Bernard Arnault and his family, who own luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, moved into the No. 1 spot.

But this time around, the dip has not affected Musk's rank among the wealthiest people in the world.

According to multiple news outlets, Musk may have overpaid for X. The company valued itself at $19 billion as of Monday – about 55% less than what Musk paid last year, according to Forbes. Musk admitted to overpaying at the time, which was one of the reasons he cited for trying to back out of the deal.

Musk brought many changes to the company since he acquired it, and some users feared he might loosen policies that combat hate speech on the platform. He also rolled out a paid subscription system for users, which has been tweaked over time. He also revealed that ad sales on the platform were down 60%.

Tesla, which also greatly attributes to Musk's worth, has also faced problems this year. Last month, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a federal lawsuit alleging White employees at Tesla used racial slurs against Black co-workers at the company's factory in Fremont, California.

In another legal battle earlier this year, Tesla's directors, who were accused of overpaying themselves, agreed to return more than $700 million to the company, according to Reuters.

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, rolled out two new subscription plans on Friday, including a Premium+ tier for users willing to pay for an ad-free experience.

The Premium+ plan, priced at about $16 per month, includes all the tools and features offered by the platform, minus the ads, the company said in a post on the platform.

It will, however, be available for users accessing the platform through a web browser for now, it added.

The basic tier is priced at $3 per month but is not ad-free.

X is also planning to bundle video and audio calling for some users, in a push to turn the platform into an everything app.

Musk has been exploring several options to extensively monetize the social media platform, which he acquired for $44 billion in October 2022.

Elon Musk's net worth drops $41 billion on Tesla earnings amid EV souring
********
Elon Musk’s net worth suffered yet another multibillion-dollar hit on October 30. And the Halloween-eve hair-raiser adds a cackling skeleton to a horror arcade of ghoulish news for EVs.

By 2:15 PM, Tesla shares had fallen from the previous close of $207 to $197 or 5%, lowering the value of Musk’s 715 million shares and vested options by $7 billion in just less than five hours of trading. That drop deepens the sharp decline that started when Musk unveiled disappointing Q3 earnings, and a poor outlook, after the market close on October 17. Since that date, Tesla’s shares have fallen by 23%, erasing $189 billion in market capitalization, and hammering the wealth for the world’s richest person by $41 billion.

It’s unclear what caused the steep one-day decline. But an announcement from Panasonic, Tesla’s largest battery supplier, that it’s lowering production due to a fall in EV demand, could be a factor. Or, the markets may simply be revaluing Tesla as primarily a metal-bending car manufacturer, as opposed to the vision that Musk has long promoted of a tech phenomenon promising software-sized margins. Tesla’s Q3 numbers, and Musk’s dour comments on the earnings call, suggest that Tesla’s profitability is trending rapidly towards that of its automative peers, and not toward the Oracle-like heights he’s been advertising.

For the quarter, the EV-leader recorded operating margins, excluding environmental credits, of just 5.3%, down from 16.1% in Q3 of last year. The normally ebullient Musk also dampened expectations for his forthcoming cybertruck, admitting that the futuristic vehicle forged from flat, stainless steel panels is so extremely expensive and complicated to build that “we shot ourselves in the foot” by pursuing the project. He gave no hope that margins will rebound, stating that––given the spike in interest rates––only by continuing to discount prices can Tesla keep monthly payments affordable, and volumes high.

While Tesla slashes prices, GM and Ford are both slowing their rollouts for EVs

In the last several weeks, Ford and GM both declared that they’re sharply curbing ambitious plans for EVs. On October 17, GM announced that it will postpone the $4 billion repurposing of its Orion assembly plant in Michigan to manufacture electric pickup trucks from late 2024 to late 2025, delaying the rollout of models including the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV. On the earnings call, CFO Paul Jacobson said that GM will no longer follow its previous blueprint to sell 400,000 EVs from 2022 to mid-2024, and produce 100,000 during the second half of this year. Instead of providing new targets, GM will follow a flexible path by matching output to current sales that’s running much lower than it forecast.

In her third-quarter letter, CEO Mary Barra wrote that the delays are needed to “protect prices,” and “adjust to slower near-term growth in demand.” GM repeated its goal of reaching capacity of one million EVs by the end of 2025. But it’s predicting EBIT margins of “low to mid single digits” by that time, an outlook for profitability that slenderly raises the odds for future slowdowns in GM’s EV campaign. On October 26, the automaker’s ambitions in the space took another setback when GM and Honda canceled a $5 billion partnership, in place for just a year, to develop a series of affordable compact SUVs.

As for Ford, it’s experienced poor sales on its first-generation EVs, and revealed losses in its electric segment rose to $1.3 billion in Q3 alone, twice the figure from last year. Pressure from its newly signed union contract that will raise wages 25% and provide cost-of-living adjustments over the next four-plus years is clearly pushing Ford to achieve far better productivity before accelerating its push into those deficit-generating offerings. On the October 26 earnings call, the Ford brass announced that they’re delaying $12 billion in EV investments, and provided no timetable on when they’ll unveil a new schedule. CFO John Lawler even suggested that Ford could reduce its previous commitments to EV investments, declaring that the $12 billion plan is provisional, and “it doesn’t mean that we have to go ahead and pull the trigger if we don’t need to. And we’re going to look at the overall EV business and be balanced about that.”

On the call, CEO Jim Farley acknowledged the thrust of why the U.S. giants are retreating. He maintained that customers are simply not willing to pay a premium for EVs over gas or hybrid vehicles. And of course, EVs cost much, much more to make. Those simple, scary economics have dashed enthusiasm over the “cars of the future.” Only when the economics improve big time will the a new wave of optimism chase those ghosts that have given Elon Musk such a grave Halloween season.

Backlash after Elon Musk labels Scottish first minister Humza Yousaf racist
********
Elon Musk has provoked a furious backlash in Scotland by accusing Humza Yousaf of being “a blatant racist” after the tech billionaire saw a highly selective clip of a speech by the first minister.

Musk, the owner of Tesla, Space X and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, reacted to a 45-second clip of Yousaf listing all the senior public posts in Scotland held by white people, which was posted on X by an anonymous account called End Wokeness.

The account, which has a paid-for blue verification mark, accused Yousaf, who is Scotland’s first ethnic minority first minister, of “openly despising white people”. It said: “Why would Scotland’s parliament and King select a guy who hates almost 100% of the country?”

Musk replied: “What a blatant racist!”

What a blatant racist! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2023

Musk was quickly challenged on X, while Yousaf responded by posting a gif of an Asian shopkeeper from the BBC Scotland sitcom Still Game doing a shimmying dance in his shop with the words “racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence”.

Racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence.



Me: pic.twitter.com/DsKRWRhnIy — Humza Yousaf (@HumzaYousaf) October 27, 2023

Numerous posts pointed out that Yousaf had been arguing that Scotland’s public sector and institutions were not demonstrating a clear commitment to racial diversity given nearly every one was run by white people.

The Ferret news website subjected the post, which reused a clip from an account called ChurchillsCigar, to its factchecking service and found it was false. It said the extract was a highly selective excerpt of a broader statement, a conclusion reposted by critics of Yousaf’s government.

The excerpt of Yousaf’s statement has been repeatedly amplified in Scotland by far-right nativist groups who claim it was racist. Audience members and protesters have also accused him of racism at events.

Yousaf has been widely praised for his handling of the Israel-Hamas crisis, hosting meetings with Jewish leaders and the widow of a Jewish man murdered by Hamas and issuing joint statements condemning the violence. His wife, Nadia El-Nakla, is half-Palestinian and his first wife was white.

The clip was taken from May 2020 when Yousaf was speaking to MSPs on a motion in support of anti-racist activism after the death of George Floyd, where he discussed the racism he had experienced since being elected.

“Some people have been surprised or taken aback by my mention on my social media that at 99% of the meetings that I go to, I am the only non-white person in the room,” he told the chamber. “Why are we so surprised when the most senior positions in Scotland are filled almost exclusively by people who are white?”

He then listed all the senior judicial, policing and legal posts in his justice portfolio held by white people, and said the same could be found in health, another portfolio he held.

“Almost every trade union in the country, headed by people who are white people,” he added. “In the Scottish government, every director general is white. Every chair of every public body is white. That is not good enough.”

A spokesperson for Yousaf said on Friday: “The first minister has been on the receiving end of racist hate, abuse and death threats his entire life, and has stood firm against hatred and bigotry, of any kind, throughout.

“Sadly, much of the racist abuse and threats of violence the first minister faces are directed his way on X. Mr Musk should use his position to tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns.”

Elon Musk will demonetize X users spreading false information
********
Elon Musk has warned creators who come to X and spread untruths they will see their proceeds from the platform ripped away.

Currently the arbiters of right and wrong on X are a group of volunteers charged with crowd-sourcing verification of content on the site.

The Community Notes function has proved relatively popular with users. The individuals who have taken it upon themselves to add verification footnotes for posts are also a boon for Musk—they’re effectively policing his site free of charge.

However, in an announcement late on Sunday, Musk handed more power to Community Notes amid claims the entrepreneur is not doing enough to fulfill his legal obligations in Europe: preventing the spread of disinformation under the new Digital Services Act.

“Any posts that are corrected by Community Notes become ineligible for revenue share,” he posted. “The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism.”

For anyone wondering who will watch the watchmen, Musk claimed the system would be self-correcting thanks to his decision to open his programming code up for public scrutiny.

As a result, he said any attempts by his cohort of online safety sentinels to wield their collective authority as a weapon against creators they dislike would be “immediately obvious.”

Making a slight change to creator monetization:



Any posts that are corrected by @CommunityNotes become ineligible for revenue share.



The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 29, 2023

The move comes shortly after the EU Commission launched a formal inquiry into whether the platform formerly known as Twitter had violated its obligations under the DSA. Days later Brussels followed with similar moves targeting Meta and TikTok.

A year of Musk at X

Last week’s one-year anniversary of Musk’s takeover of Twitter was a bittersweet one for the tycoon.

He had poorly timed his April 2022 bid, making an offer of $44 billion just before the stock market began to sell off. Subsequently he was forced to overpay dearly, financing the deal with $13 billion in debt he borrowed as interest rates were rising.

First he sought to raise much-needed cash by selling verification badges to anyone that wanted them. To placate high profile accounts often targeted by imposters, he’s now begun offering them a share of the ad revenue.

Since the subscriber revenue has failed to offset the money he’s lost from advertisers fleeing his platform, X now announced two new plans called Basic and Premium+ to flank its Premium subscription in the hopes of capturing more stable, recurring revenue.

Only by paying $16 a month for Premium+ will users no longer be fed ads in their timeline.

Elon Musk tells Joe Rogan the reason he would beat Mark Zuckerberg in a fight
********
Both Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg know they only need to dial Dana White's phone number in order to make a fight happen between them. When they started challenging each other to an MMA fight, Zuckerberg didn't feel like the X CEO was actually serious due to all the antics revolving the potential fight. Elon threatened to even show up to Zuckerberg's house while live streaming the event in order to fight hi in his back yard. At a certain moment, Zuckerberg did back down and Musk just called him out on Joe Rogan. He also claims he would fight Mark Zuckerberg at any type of discipline and anywhere in the world. But the most interesting part of this admission was Musk's explanation to why he would beat Zuckerberg.

Mark Zuckerberg gets crushed during UFC training Marca English

Elon Musk's reasons he would beat Mark Zuckerberg

Here's where it got interesting, Elon Musk goes on to tell Joe Rogan he is pretty certain he would beat Mark Zuckerberg. The main reason he kept repeating was the evident weight difference. Rogan showed a picture of fellow podcaster Lex Fridman from the time Musk trained some grappling with him and UFC legend Georges St. Pierre. Elon talks about how Lex is slightly larger and heavier than Zuckerberg and how he didn't struggle too much with on the mats. There is only a small but very important difference that Musk is currently overlooking. Lex Fridman knows Jiu-Jitsu but Mark Zuckerberg has been training actual mixed martial arts for a few years now.

When an MMA fighter reaches a certain level, there is a threshold they reach where size becomes secondary, with certain exceptions. Elon Musk said he is about 240 pounds, which is not extremely heavy. The level of training Zuckerberg has undergone so far is much greater than any type of experience Elon Musk currently has. That seems to not register inside Elon's head. He keeps challenging Zuckerberg with no actual knowledge of how in danger he could be locked in a cage with the Meta CEO.

Elon Musk just launched X's latest feature: the ability to make audio and video calls on the platform.

This idea has been in the works for some time, and Musk clarified this week that these are currently "early versions" of the site's new communication tools.

It's unclear whether this service is only available for users who pay for verification through X's Premium subscription, which costs $8 a month on the web and $11 a month on the app.

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours.

The new features have failed to impress some X users, however.

"Who asked for this?" read one post on X. "Elon is wasting money on pointless things — we already have WhatsApp, discord, and default messaging apps?"

"That sounds great for those who want it, of which I am not one," said another user in response to Musk's post.

Musk has spoken often about his plans to transform the platform – formerly known as Twitter – into an "everything app" similar to China's WeChat, which offers messaging and video chatting, food delivery, banking, and shopping among other things.

Since he took over the company in 2022, he has added a series of new features, including the ability to post longer videos and an overhauled paid verification system.

He also said that X will soon begin offering financial services and the ability to pay for things – promising that users would be able to manage their "entire financial world" on the app.

For all its new features, X has still struggled to reverse a drop in users following months of chaos on the social media platform.

Diving Into Elon Musk’s Mind
********
Segment Transcript

FLORA LICHTMAN: For the rest of the hour, we’re talking about someone very in the public eye. Ira is here with that. Hey, Ira.

IRA FLATOW: Thanks, Flora. About 17 years ago, way back in 2006, I had a guest on the show, an entrepreneur and engineer struggling to get recognition for a new idea, a spaceship not made by NASA, but a private company, a radical idea in its day, with a radical man behind it. The company was called SpaceX, and the engineer, not quite a household name, Elon Musk.

[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

– Elon, is there a barrier for the privatization of space?

– I don’t think there is a barrier, in the sense of there being, say, some law against it or something like that. There’s a barrier of execution, which I think has not been exceeded. It is extremely difficult to do. There’s a reason why there’s an adiabatic expression about something very difficult being– or something being easy not being rocket science.

It is really difficult, and it’s a problem, which is both a problem of technical execution and business execution, and nobody’s really been able to solve that yet. And we’re aspiring to do so with SpaceX, but it’s really up to us. I think if we fail, it’s our fault, not anyone else’s.

[END PLAYBACK]

IRA FLATOW: Elon Musk. A lot has changed in those 17 years. And since then, Musk his trials and tribulations are constantly in the news. And while Elon no longer answers the phone when we call, he’s been very busy starting businesses. There’s the Tesla electric cars, the home solar and battery installations, the SpaceX rockets– which have become hugely successful since he got the SciFri bump, of course, sure– the Boring Company seeking to build underground passageways, Neuralink, an implantable device in the brain, X, the company once known as Twitter, and Optimus, a robot.

And woven throughout it all is a mix of technical savvy, confident ego, and sometimes impulsive decision-making and harsh treatment of his staff. And while I had a brief visit with Elon in his Rocket Lab more than a decade ago, biographer Walter Isaacson spent two years with the mercurial inventor and has tried to sort through the competing influences behind Elon Musk in a biography of the same name. Walter is the former CEO of the Aspen Institute, also former chair of CNN, editor of Time, and now a prolific author, professor of history at Tulane University, and author of Elon Musk. Welcome back to Science Friday, Walter.

WALTER ISAACSON: It’s great to be back with you, Ira.

IRA FLATOW: Nice to have you. Walter, I’ve got to say that the Elon we talked to 17 years ago in that clip seems to have morphed from a quiet, almost deferential, please-pay-attention-to-my-ideas guy, to the hard-hitting, ego-driven futurist of today. And I’m wondering, did you have preconceived notions about Musk, and did they change as you spent two years with him?

WALTER ISAACSON: Absolutely. And one of the things about that clip is there are certain things that haven’t changed. His understanding that if you’re going to get rockets into orbit and, more amazingly, get things into orbit and then re-land the rockets and reuse them, it’s a question of both execution and a business model. And nowadays, Boeing can’t do that. China, and Russia, and the US can’t re-land rockets and reuse them. So execution was the key to, I think, his success in the space business.

My preconception, when I went in almost three years ago, I said, OK, a guy building rockets and bringing us into the era of electric vehicles, and solar roofs, and power walls, this will be interesting in terms of technology and pushing the boundaries of science. And it was really part of a trilogy. I had done Steve Jobs to show how we got into the age of the personal digital revolution, and then Jennifer Doudna, in the era of gene editing and life sciences. And this seemed like it was going to be about rockets and electric cars. But of course, it certainly changed over the past three years, as he got more involved in more and more things. And his, let us politely say, mercurial personality distracted from some of the science and technology he was doing.

IRA FLATOW: Why was he so distracting?

WALTER ISAACSON: That personality is so changeable in him. And he says, I’m built for a storm. I’m built for surges. And when I started writing the book, he had been Person of the Year at Time that year and the Financial Times and was enormously successful. But he said, this unnerves me. I’m the type of person who, when I’m playing a video game, can’t stop. I’ve got to move to the next level of the game. And there was an odd, disquieting sense to him.

And he said, it came back to his childhood. His childhood was tumultuous in South Africa, a father who was psychologically brutal to him, in ways. He was a kid who had no friends and was beaten up all the time. And then his father would take the side of the people who beat him up. Talulah Riley, his second wife, I think, told me, he associates turmoil and drama with childhood and with love. And so I just think he’s always got to surge into the next level, even when it’s self-destructive.

IRA FLATOW: So he’s always looking to create drama if it doesn’t exist.

WALTER ISAACSON: You know, his brother, Kimbal, said those exact words, that he’s a drama magnet. And I think that propensity to drama is connected to a desire to take risks. One of his birthday parties– I have the picture in the book– they have a blind knife thrower throwing at a target, and Musk stands there with a pink balloon between his legs, in his crotch. Now, there’s no upside to taking that risk and sort of a downside. But he said, I’m addicted to risk.

IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday from WNYC Studios. And that’s why he takes a risk, with a disruptive kind of technology that no one else will take a risk on.

WALTER ISAACSON: You’re right. You can’t be that disruptive without taking risks. And I remember we were standing at the High Bay, down in the South tip of Texas, where he’s trying to launch Starship. And he said, we used to be a nation of risk-takers. He was looking to the Rio Grande. He said, people come to this country, whether they came on the Mayflower or across the Rio Grande. They love taking risks, and that’s why we were so innovative. But he said, nowadays, we’ve become a country, a society, with more referees than risk-takers, more regulators than doers.

And so I think pushing the risk is why he is able to get rockets into space, but also– when I was down there for that Starship launch in April, he got it into space the biggest rocket ever made. But after three minutes, it blew up, and there was hot rubble in its wake. And that was a metaphor for Elon Musk. He does amazing things, but leaves a lot of hot rubble in the wake.

IRA FLATOW: And the drama of that too, right?

WALTER ISAACSON: Absolutely. And it was so odd. It was on a Monday that they were doing the countdown for the attempt. And at t-minus 14, he looks, and there’s a couple of problems with some leaky valves. He just shakes his head and Shaina Diaz, the launch director, she stops the countdown.

Elon flies off to an ad conference in Miami right after that, meets Linda Yaccarino, who was the Ad Sales Director at NBC Universal, almost impulsively hires her on the spot, knowing she is what he needs at Twitter, now X, and then gets back just in time for 5:00 AM for a Thursday launch of Starship. And once again, got down to t-minus 20, and there’s a couple– there are 33 engines, as you know, on the booster for Starship. And two of them weren’t seeming that well-off. But this time, he nods and says, let’s take the risk. And what happens is both a rocket that gets to space and one that also blows up, like the first three rockets he had launched 20 years earlier.

IRA FLATOW: Hmm, you speak of the drama, but you also speak about how driven he was, not only driving himself, but driving his employees, to the point they were rebelling against him sometimes.

WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah, it’s very hard to work for him, but those who do are all-in. They’re hardcore. And it’s interesting because I, over and over again, in the book, show him reaming somebody out or having some problem. And then I’ll go back to that person a month later, two months later, and say, OK, what’d you do? Did you survive? Did you leave? Why?

Many of them left. And one of them, in particular, which I’ll give you an example– late on a Friday night, at Starbase, a year ago, well before they’re going to launch Starship, Musk is wandering the factory line. And then we go to the launch pad, and there were only a few people working on the launch pad. And there’s a poor guy, Andy Krebs, who was in charge of that launch pad. And Musk reams him out.

And Andy Krebs is like, wait, it’s Friday night at 10:00 PM, and we don’t have a launch scheduled. And he says, no, we have to be hardcore, all-in, or we’ll never get to Mars. And so after a while, Andy knows how to deal with it, and he actually gets promoted. And then about a year later, he’s like, all right, I’m burned out, and he finally leaves.

But I saw him a few weeks ago. I happened to be on book tour in Los Angeles. And Andy Krebs walks up to me. I said, what’s happening? He said, well, I have a choice of being burned out or being bored. And now I’m bored, and I think I want to go back to SpaceX. So it’s an interesting dynamic of when you push people, like Steve Jobs did, to do things they thought drove them crazy, but then they end up also doing things they thought were impossible.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah, and I’m glad you brought Steve Jobs up, someone else you have written about, and also Jennifer Doudna, who, I would guess, these two are contemporaries. How would you compare them? I mean, let’s say Steve Jobs, who was also a disruptor?

WALTER ISAACSON: Steve Jobs was a disruptor, and he had a reality distortion field, which meant when people said something was impossible, he would sometimes stare at them without blinking and say, don’t be afraid, you can do it. And he said about me, he said, you care a lot about empathy. You want to be really sweet to all the people around you, and sometimes that’s selfish because it’s merely because you want people to like you. And sometimes you lose sight of the enterprise because you’re so eager to have people like you. And I thought back and said, yeah, maybe that’s why I wasn’t very good when I was running CNN. I was too eager to be liked, and I was not disruptive enough.

Well, Elon Musk is the same way. He runs roughshod over people a lot of the time, but he also inspires them and makes them understand why the higher mission might be worth it. But Jennifer Doudna, who I just adore, she was different because she’s very collegial. Anytime somebody was thinking of joining her lab, everybody else in the lab had to meet them to say, do we like this person? Will this person fit in?

And so there are different ways of being a great leader. You can be like Jennifer Doudna and very collegial. You can be all-in and hardcore like Musk and Jobs. When you write biographies, you don’t say, here’s the right answer. You kind of say, let me tell you a story, and then you let people figure out for themselves, how does that relate to what I want to be?

IRA FLATOW: We’ve heard a lot about, as you say, the rough side of Elon Musk. And I’ve been following his speeches and statements over the years. And when you look at those statements, when he’s sort of not really preaching, when he’s sort of more thoughtful, he seems to have his heart in the right place. And I mean by that he wants to make our energy green and sustainable. He wants to make sure we have a place to go on Mars, when we use up the Earth. There seems to be a conflict between what’s in his heart and what comes out of his mouth sometimes.

WALTER ISAACSON: Well, when I say he’s mercurial, another way to say it is he really does have multiple personalities. And you can be with him in the day or in an evening, and he’ll be really inspirational. And he’s got three great missions in life that he picked up reading comic books and sci-fi in the corner of the library, when he was a kid without friends and very lonely.

And as you say, one of them is to make us multi-planetary. We have to be space adventurers again. Second is to have sustainable energy, to keep this planet OK, not just with electric vehicles, but solar roofs and power walls. And the third is to make sure our robots don’t turn on us. He probably read Isaac Asimov’s robot stories once too often. But it was, we have to make sure AI is beneficial, not harmful to humanity.

And so these become his great missions. And when he’s in a mission-driven, inspirational mode, he can be great. But there are times when he gets resentful, or dark, or sometimes conspiratorial. And people around him, you almost just have to wait out those moods. Grimes, his girlfriend, calls them demon mode. And you just wait until the storm passes.

IRA FLATOW: Mhm, you mentioned those two out of three ideals. And you mentioned the third one is AI, artificial intelligence. Is he working heavily on that? I know he’s got he’s got the robot, and he’s got the superchips he’s building for the car. Are those part of the idea?

WALTER ISAACSON: Yes, at the end of the book, right after the Starship, and Twitter, and everything else, he says, come on back to Austin. I’ve got to spend some time with you and not on the telephone. It’s got to be done in person. And he’s over at the House of Shivon Zilis, who’s a mother of two of his children, but runs Neuralink, which is the company that now, this month, gotten permission to implant chips in human trials so that our brainwaves can connect to our computers.

He believes that’s part of making artificial intelligence safe, which is having an alignment between our will and consciousness and that of the processing power of computers, also, as you said, the Dojo chip, which will process visual information and try to create artificial intelligence for real world use, like self-driving cars and robots, not just large language models that do predictive text so you can chat bot things. So that’s his new company, called xAI, and it’s to compete with ChatGPT, and Microsoft, and Google to try to make sure we have artificial intelligence that’s aligned with our values and our will as humans.

IRA FLATOW: Interesting. How is he able to juggle all these different projects, because he really is a hands-on person, isn’t he?

WALTER ISAACSON: Yes, he’s very much of a serial mono-tasker, with a fanatic focus.

IRA FLATOW: Not a multitasker.

WALTER ISAACSON: No, I once called him a multitasker. And I I’d correct it because he doesn’t do 10 things at once. He does one thing at a time, undistracted, and with an intense focus. For example, when the Twitter board decided to accept his offer, that night, he flew down to the South tip of Texas to be in a conference room to deal with Starship. And everybody and the engineers in that room, they’re all like, this guy just bought Twitter. The whole world is talking about it.

He doesn’t mention it. He’s focused on a methane leak in the Raptor engine for Starship. And for more than an hour, they deal with the materials of the valve and how it could be fixed. And he doesn’t get distracted, then, by something like Twitter. And in a given day– I’d be flying around with him or going to different meetings– he will focus for an hour or two on how should self-driving cars make a left-hand turn when there’s a bike lane. Then he would focus on the anode and cathode for the new battery that Tesla would have to do.

And 99% of what Tesla, and SpaceX, and Neuralink, and xAI, and Twitter would be doing would be run by some other people. But he said, it’s like Napoleon. If you get on the battlefield and you’re focusing on one thing, the troops see you focus, they see you down in the details, and the rest will take care of itself.

IRA FLATOW: And he believes, himself, as you point out in the book, that he should be down there with the troops, watching how everything happens, so he can keep an eye on it. He mentioned how, as an engineer, he believes you have to be on the site. You can’t do this remotely.

WALTER ISAACSON: You know, once, at around midnight, I was down in his only home, down in Texas. And he’s making people install a solar roof and seeing if they can do it in one day. And he’s up there. He climbs up the ladder to the peak of this roof. I got to follow him up there. I was, like, bouncing on this roof. And the supervisor, who’s down on the ground, is saying, here’s why we do it. He said to the supervisor, have you ever actually nailed a tile in? Have you ever installed a roof? And the supervisor says, no, I’m a designer. You know, I supervise. He said, no, if you’ve never actually gotten on the roof and done it yourself, you don’t know what the blank you’re talking about. And he fires the dude.

But that’s Musk. He’s there on the roof, doing that. And then later in the day, he’ll be insisting that the designers of, say, the new Tesla have their desk on the assembly line so they see what happens each step of the way for something they’ve designed. So he believes innovation comes from that iterative process of really being hands-on.

IRA FLATOW: You describe engineering at SpaceX and his dislikes of specifications or requirements from outside, that they should be recommendations and not rules. Is that a common theme, that outside rules don’t necessarily apply?

WALTER ISAACSON: He has an algorithm that has five steps, and step 1 is question every rule and regulation. And somebody will say, there’s a– and he’ll say, who made that regulation? I want to know the name of the person and what that person knows. He says, the only rules and regulations you have to follow are the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.

IRA FLATOW: That’s very interesting. Were you surprised at the amount of access he gave you, and the transparency of letting you watch his decision-making in real-time, and inviting you along, as you say, when he’s going to make a big decision?

WALTER ISAACSON: I was totally blown away by it. And even when he’s, like, reaming people out, or with his girlfriend, or whatever it may be, he was just open and transparent. And you and your listeners would know of the Heisenberg problem, which is if I’m observing this particle, am I affecting its position, momentum, whatever it may be? And it never seemed to. I receded into the background, and he hardly would notice me.

But even on the night when he’s plotting with his bankers to do a surprise close of the Twitter deal so he can deny the old Twitter leadership their severance package, I’m sitting there in the room. And the lawyers are looking at me, the bankers are looking at me like, uh, why is this guy in this room? But Musk just gives a little nod and says, it’s OK. And so you read about it in the book. You read about him deciding to make the $25,000 cheap car for Tesla, which hadn’t been public or starting xAI. He said nothing’s off limits.

IRA FLATOW: One of the things that people probably know him most for is Tesla and the car. And one of the most controversial parts of that car is full self-driving or the ability of the car to actually drive itself, which it can’t do yet. Why is he so focused on this mission of full self-driving?

WALTER ISAACSON: It’s one of those things where he focuses intensely on the future, and he keeps trying to force it to get there, sometimes faster than it can. Every year, from 2016 on, he says, we’re going to have full self-driving within a year. And it always recedes. He’s doing something phenomenally interesting now– and once again, I got to be in the secret meeting where that’s decided, which is even now, if you have full self-driving on a Tesla, it’s done by algorithm. In other words, there’s hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ coding that the engineers do that say things like, if you see a red light, stop, and if there’s a double yellow line, don’t cross it. If you’re making a left turn this way and there’s a crosswalk, do this.

And now he’s doing it the way ChatGPT does large language model predictive intelligence. And instead of making it rules-based, he’s feeding billions of frames from Tesla car cameras into this supercomputers, NVIDIA and now Dojo. And they’re processing the visual data to do human imitation so that instead of doing it based on rules, it’s done based on what millions of human drivers have done in such a situation. And that will be full self-driving 12, FSD 12. And it will be an AI version of it, basically an end-to-end neural network. And so that’s still not ready yet. It’s still going to take quite a while, but he’s still hoping he’ll have it done in a year.

IRA FLATOW: So you’re trying to find the people who drive best and imitate what they’re doing.

WALTER ISAACSON: Exactly, they’re feeding in all the drivers. But he says he also has, as I’ve seen, a bunch of people– I think, some in Buffalo, New York– who are watching all the drivers’ videos and rating them, just like you would an Uber driver, and say this one’s five-star, this one’s two-star. So it not only drives like an average human, it will learn to drive like the best human drivers.

IRA FLATOW: This is, like, come full circle for me. When I was in college, studying industrial engineering, back in the day, they would ask us to go on to a floor where they make widgets. And as an industrial engineer, you’re trying to find somebody who does it the best, can make 10 widgets an hour instead of only nine. And so you go see that person, and you want everybody else to imitate how that person makes a widget. This is exactly the same thing.

WALTER ISAACSON: Human imitation is the way our neural networks work and our brain. I mean, you may be taught by your parents the rules for eating spaghetti and put your fork this way, but 99% of it is watching people eat spaghetti or speak language. And that’s what his new, what he calls, real world artificial intelligence is aiming to do, whether it be robots or self-driving cars.

IRA FLATOW: Is it because he’s willing to take a chance on something new, where big companies hardly ever take chances on new things?

WALTER ISAACSON: He says, big companies, and governments, and even societies like ours used to be risk-takers, but now they got more regulators than risk-takers, more referees than doers, and more people in the legal department and the finance department saying, no, no, that wouldn’t be safe, stopping that. And he says– and sometimes I think he goes too far– he says we got to be like America used to be. We have to build our own factories. We have to see what works, and we have to take risks.

IRA FLATOW: Well, people who take risks have to be ready for failure too. How does he deal with that?

WALTER ISAACSON: He blew up– you talked to him way back then. The first three Falcon rockets blow up. By the way, Starship, last April, got three minutes into space, totally amazing, and then it blew up. I think that you’ve got to be able to learn from failures. And if you’re a Boeing or a NASA, you just do not launch unless every single person is signed off on every single risk, which means Boeing hasn’t been able to get a rocket with astronauts to the Space Station.

IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday, from WNYC Studios. You mentioned looking to the future, and we talked about Mars. Do you think he will actually be able to get there?

WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah, we will get to Mars, as a species, of course. And Starship, his rocket, I think, someday, will get there. He would hope it would be in 10 years. I would suspect that’s Elon time, and you double it, at least.

IRA FLATOW: [LAUGHS]

WALTER ISAACSON: I suspect– I mean, we’ve already gotten the Rover to Mars. But I suspect that Starship will be making missions to Mars and perhaps even missions with humans to Mars 20 or so years from now. And you got to keep your eye on that horizon. He does a meeting almost every week called Mars Colonizer, where he’s like, what are we going to wear when we get to Mars? How are we going to govern ourselves? And I have to pinch myself and say, these are real grown-ups talking about what we’re going to wear when we’re living on Mars. But looking into the future like that kind of inspires you to get over the hump each day.

IRA FLATOW: And, Walter, I bet you get asked this question all the time. But as an interviewer, I’ve got to ask it also. Given all the controversy he stirs, do you think Elon is a good person overall?

WALTER ISAACSON: There are moments when he’s inspiring and good. But as I always say about Musk, it’s not as if there’s only one person or personality you’re dealing with. You’re seeing a guy who can go through a lot of moods and personalities. Overall, he has single-handedly done more than any other individual to get us into the era of electric vehicles and to connect them to solar roofs and power walls. Likewise, he’s single-handedly got us back into the era of space exploration and even making rockets that can land and be reused, which is the Holy Grail. He’s also, I think, moving us into the era of self-driving cars.

All of these are huge advances for humanity. But I also look, metaphorically, at the rockets he’s launched and the rubble he’s left in his wake, the human cost, the way he can be callous and even been cruel to people. And I say, does that make it worth it? Does that justify it? And I say, well, I wouldn’t want to be that way. But then again, I say, but I’m never going to be the one who shoots a rocket that gets to Mars.

IRA FLATOW: You’ve told us, dramatically, what Musk is doing. What’s your next act? What are you working on? What should we expect to see?

WALTER ISAACSON: I love being back in my hometown of New Orleans, teaching the next generation of students here at Tulane. I teach The Digital Revolution and Innovation. I also always am looking for a science person who might be the next inspiration. I’ve been looking recently at, I think, one of the people who truly brought us into the 20th century science, who understood that chemistry was physics, and then she wins a Nobel Prize in both fields, the first woman to do so and first only to win in two sciences. And I think Marie Curie and the things that she had to push up against, to me, are totally fascinating.

IRA FLATOW: All right, so we’ll look forward to that. That’ll be–

WALTER ISAACSON: Have me back on, please.

IRA FLATOW: Absolutely, you can come back on anytime you’d like, Walter. Walter Isaacson, author of the book Elon Musk, it’s a terrific read. Sit down, it’s, like, 90 little chunks in there that you can read pretty quickly and enjoy it for all it’s worth. Walter is Professor of History at Tulane University. Thank you all for taking time to be with us today and for your work.

WALTER ISAACSON: Thank you, Ira.

Wikipedia owner responds after Elon Musk offers $1 billion to change their name
********
It doesn't look like Wikipedia will be changing it's name anytime soon.

The free online encyclopaedia is currently asking for donations to fund the site and, with this in mind, multibillionaire Elon Musk said he'd give them some money.

But it came with a catch - he wanted the site to rename its as 'D*ckipedia'.

Advert 10

Loading…

Sharing a screenshot of a message on the Wikipedia site saying 'Wikipedia is not for sale', Musk shared a yawn-face emoji.

He then reposted his own tweet with the statement: "I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to D*ckipedia."

Musk added that he wants a cow and poop emoji also added to his Wikipedia page.

Advert 10

As to why he wants it changed to 'D*ckipedia', the 52-year-old argued it's 'in the interests of accuracy'.

In light of his offer, it appears as if founder Jimmy Wales has responded to it.

In a message on Wikipedia's site titled 'Wikipedia: not beholden to anyone but you', Wales said: "We're sorry to interrupt, but it's Tuesday, October 24, and time will soon run out to help us in today's short fundraiser.

Advert 10

"I ask you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year, the value you got from it, and whether you're able to give $3 to the Wikimedia Foundation."

Elsewhere the statement, Wales said: "It's hard to know what to trust online these days. Disinformation and scammers are everywhere."

Following his offer yesterday, Musk appeared to make a dig at the site as he questioned why it's always looking for donations.

"Have you ever wondered why the Wikimedia Foundation wants so much money?" the tech billionaire asked.

"It certainly isn’t needed to operate Wikipedia. You can literally fit a copy of the entire text on your phone!

"So, what’s the money for? Inquiring minds want to know..."

Despite often asking for donations, Wikipedia has always denied being strapped for cash.

"Based on guidance from the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, our reserve amounts to one year of operating budget," Samantha Lien, a spokeswoman for the Wikimedia Foundation previously told The Washington Post.

Tesla and Anti-Union Elon Musk Are Enticing Next Targets for UAW
********
After a self-proclaimed victory over Detroit’s automakers, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain has made clear where he’ll direct his energy next.

“One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we’ve never organized before,” Fain said Sunday. “When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won’t just be with a Big Three, but with a Big Five or Big Six.”

Several major car companies, including Toyota and Volkswagen, have auto plants in the US that employ non-union workers, but there’s one particularly enticing target for the UAW: Tesla. It’s the most valuable automaker in ...

The banks which loaned Elon Musk money to help buy Twitter expect to lose $2 billion on the debt, report says
********

Wall Street helped Elon Musk buy Twitter last year by loaning him $13 billion.

The banks are now preparing to unload the debt, and expect to take a 15% hit, per the WSJ.

The biggest lenders like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America would lose hundreds of millions of dollars.

The banks which helped Elon Musk take over Twitter are expecting to lose $2 billion on the loans they gave him, according to The Wall Street Journal.

When the world's richest person agreed to buy the social media company for $44 billion last October, $13 billion was loaned by the likes of Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Barclays. The loans are backed by some of Musk's Tesla stock.

In the year Musk has owned the platform, X — as Twitter is now called — has faced a number of struggles.

Downloads of the app fell by almost 30% between July and September, according to data from Apptopia. And the marketing consultancy Ebiquity, which works with 70 of the world's top 100 advertisers, says just two of them advertised on X last month.

Fidelity, the asset manager which owns a stake in the company, has marked Twitter's valuation down by two-thirds. That would make the company worth around $15 billion.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk's lenders have started preparing to unload the debt.

Bankers close to the deal told The Journal that X could be given a junk-bond rating, meaning it is at risk of defaulting on the loans, due to both Musk's controversial management style and a waning ad market.

People familiar with the matter told the newspaper that the banks are expecting to take a hit of 15%, or $2 billion in total.

For the banks which hold the largest pieces, like Morgan Stanley and BofA, that would mean hundreds of millions in losses, according to the Journal.

X, Morgan Stanley, BofA, and Barclays did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, sent outside US working hours.

Elon Musk: The center of attention at the F1 US Grand Prix for the car he arrived with
********
It wasn't a surprise to see Elon Musk, owner of Tesla, Space X and X (Twitter), among other companies, at the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix. Tthe South African has been to the Grand Prix before on other occasions, but his arrival at the paddock did attract attention.

Of course, Musk was spotted by the televisions in the Mercedes box, the team that invited the executive, to whom the Austin track is 'on his doorstep', since Tesla's headquarters are located in the Texan capital.

As is one of its famous gigafactories, precisely the one that already hosts the production of what is probably its most talked-about model. And on board that car Musk showed up at the race. He did not go unnoticed at all, before even entering the Paddock Club of the Circuit of the Americas.

El Tesla Cybertruck será una realidad muy pronto... al menos en América. @wealthXfreedom

A free ad

As a good visionary, Musk did not miss the opportunity offered by F1 to campaign for free his next launch, the Tesla Cybertruck. An electric pickup with a controversial design that will soon receive its first owners, since the promotional act of deliveries will begin on October 30, precisely in Texas.

But, as a good boss, Musk already had a unit to make the 'ride' to the F1 paddock. Of course, as was his intention, he did not go unnoticed and, of course, he swept the fans, who recorded hundreds of videos with his arrival, have spreading their reach through social networks.

Musk did not exactly park in a secluded place, but he got 'into the kitchen' with the huge SUV of more than five meters. Even the escorts had to work hard to prevent the fans of one of the richest men in the world from having any altercation with the American public.

He was not traveling alone as he was accompanied by one of his children, the little X (the same name he has renamed - without much success, for the moment) Twitter, to whom he seems to have instilled a passion for Formula 1.

Dogecoin Has a Huge Week As Elon Musk Aims for X Financial Services To Launch by End of 2024: Report
********
The popular meme asset Dogecoin (DOGE) is surging this week as billionaire Elon Musk reportedly aims to launch financial services on the social media platform X by the end of next year.

According to a new report by The Verge, the business magnate says he expects X’s comprehensive financial features to roll out by the end of 2024 and compete with traditional banks.

As stated by Musk in a company-wide meeting, according to an audio recording obtained by The Verge,

“When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial life. If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank account…

It would blow my mind if we don’t have that rolled out by the end of next year.”

Currently, X is working on obtaining the proper licenses to be able to operate its financial services in the US, according to the report. There was no mention of Dogecoin in the call. However, since Musk is a well-known DOGE fan, Musk’s involvement in financial services tends to excite DOGE holders.

Last month, Musk shut down rumors of creating a crypto asset called “X Coin” as a means of rewarding content creators over the social media platform.

At the time, an X account claimed that the platform was going to create a digital asset specifically for rewarding users. Musk replied to the message with a simple “no,” shooting down the idea.

Meanwhile, DOGE has been flying this week, along with the rest of the crypto markets. The dog-themed memecoin went from $0.058 on October 19th to a peak of $0.74 on October 26th. Dogecoin has since retraced and is moving for $0.69 at time of writing.

Elon Musk has been accused of acting like “a little baby” and being “almost in tears” during an earnings call in which the billionaire struck a pessimistic tone about the economy.

The Tesla CEO’s behaviour on the third-quarter earnings call was slammed as “terrible” by financial analyst Kevin Paffrath and the electric automaker’s stock price dropped 15 per cent in the two days following it.

“For a leader to cry about the economy rather than funnelling that and coming up with a plan is pathetic,” Mr Paffrath, who owns Tesla stock, told Yahoo Finance.

And he added: “We need to know the light is at the end of the tunnel rather than hearing a complaining CEO who’s not actually providing that path.”

Tesla reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter results, with both earnings per share and revenue of $23.35bn falling short of analysts’ estimates, according to Yahoo Finance.

But despite the issues as of Friday, the company’s share price was up 96 per cent year-to-date.

Mr Paffrath, a YouTuber with 1.9 million followers, was not the only analyst to criticise Mr Musk’s performance.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described the call as a “mini disaster” during which a “cautious” Mr Musk downplayed expectations for the Cybertruck and focused on high interest rates.

“We dug our own grave with Cybertruck” Mr Musk said on the call, calling it a “great product” but also said he wanted to “temper expectations” for the long-awaited pickup truck.

“Demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million people who have reserved the car, so it’s not a demand issue,” he said.

“But we have to make it, and we need to make it a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things.”

The Independent has reached out to Tesla for comment.

6 eccentric things billionaire Elon Musk spends his money on
********
Since his first brush with fame, Musk has been clear that it is his personal mission to colonise Mars, and he created SpaceX with exactly that goal in mind. The billionaire believes humans need a contingency plan should Earth become non-viable, and announced in 2021 that he wants as much of his US$225 billion net worth as possible to go into the project.

But that doesn’t mean Musk doesn’t splurge at all – quite the contrary. He indulges in hobbies and vices like everyone else – his choices just tend to be a little less conventional than most.

Elon Musk, the richest man on Earth according to Forbes, lives in a rented US$50,000 “box home”, sold most of his luxury properties, and once told his former partner Grimes she couldn’t buy a new mattress when she discovered a hole in the one they were sleeping on.

Per Insider, Musk said that building a city on Mars would require “just a lot of capital” and that he wanted to “be able to contribute as much as possible”. To illustrate his seriousness about investing his fortune for “the sake of humanity”, Musk said he was eschewing material possessions, including his impressive property portfolio.

The property portfolio that disappeared

Back in 2012, Musk made headlines when he dropped US$17 million on a 20,248 sq ft mansion in Bel Air, California. According to the Los Angeles Times, the home had a two-story library, a study, wine cellar, tennis court, seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. At the time, he dropped millions investing in at least five other neighbouring properties, according to Observer.

Then, in May 2020, he had a change of heart, vowing to “own no house” so as not to be seen as materialistic by his critics, and prove his dedication to his companies. According to Sky News, he then sold seven of his homes in California for a combined US$128 million. Musk’s primary home is now a US$50,000 dollar home in Boca Chica, Texas, which he rents from SpaceX.

The James Bond submarine car

It’s no surprise that the Tesla and SpaceX boss has an interest in unusual cars. Per Insider, Musk bought the Lotus Esprit submarine car in 2013. The car is famous for its appearance in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. According to reports, Musk paid US$920,000 for the car at an auction.

According to NBC News, the car is in fact a working submarine, but one which reportedly allows the interior to fill with water, requiring the pilot to breath from an oxygen tank. In the film, however, Roger Moore who played Bond, remains completely dry. Musk said in a statement that he was disappointed the vehicle couldn’t actually transform. “What I’m going to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric power train and try to make it transform for real,” he said.

The most talked about jet in the world

The billionaire may have done away with his luxury pads, but when it comes to travel, Musk hasn’t resorted to flying economy just yet. Rather, he owns an impressive Gulfstream G650ER worth an estimated US$70 million. According to Insider, the G650 is one of the world’s fastest, largest and longest-range private aircraft.

The ultra-long-haul flagship jet grabbed headlines after Jack Sweeney, a student from Orlando, Florida, began regularly tweeting the whereabouts of the richest man on Earth. Musk enrolled in a free Federal Aviation Administration programme that allows private jet owners to conceal their locations by transmitting alternative identity codes. The hack didn’t work, however, and thanks to Sweeney, the whole world always knows where Musk, or anyone who uses his jet, is – albeit with a 24-hour delay.

Luxury cars

It’s not just the submarine car that caught his attention. Musk clearly has a thing for unusual and rare vehicles. According to Insider, over the years, he has owned a 1920 Ford Model T, a 1967 Series 1 Jaguar E-Type and a McLaren F1 that sells for an impressive US$1 million brand new.

Musk also famously sent his own 2o10 Tesla Roadster – which he used to commute to work in – up into space as part SpaceX’s February 2018 Falcon Heavy test flight. The car continues to orbit the sun.

Spending big on Coke Light

Always one to court controversy, Elon Musk tweeted this photo of his bedside table last November. Photo: @elonmusk/X

It’s no secret that Musk used to live an unhealthy lifestyle. The confessed workaholic, who has previously spoken about clocking between 100-120 hours work a week, relied heavily on caffeine to sustain him. According to Insider, he used to drink at least eight cans of Coke Light a day, as well as several big cups of coffee.

Never in short supply of his favourite beverage, Musk continues to drop money on his habit – but has at least turned to the caffeine-free version. In a social media post in 2022, he shared an image of his bedside table which showed four cans of caffeine-free Diet Coke, two guns and various other bits and pieces.

Are people giving up on EVs? Elon Musk lost $28 billion as Tesla took a beating last quarter
********
Tesla, led by Elon Musk, reported disappointing quarterly earnings, prompting investors to reevaluate their expectations for the profitability of the EV sector. Akio Toyoda, the Chairman and former CEO of Toyota, who stepped down from his role as CEO earlier this year, took the opportunity to emphasize, “People are finally seeing reality.”

Elon Musk also experienced a significant financial setback, with his net worth decreasing by almost $28 billion. Tesla, a prominent advocate for EVs, reported its lowest quarterly earnings per share in two years, falling 10 per cent below already negative analyst forecasts.

Consequently, Tesla’s shares tumbled more than 17 per cent, and the company’s market capitalization dropped by $138 billion in just over two trading days.

EV sales slowing down alarmingly

While EV sales continue to grow, the pace of growth has slowed. In the first half of 2023, EV sales increased by 49 per cent compared to the previous year, a slower rate than the 63 per cent increase seen in the prior year.

President Joe Biden has been a staunch advocate of electric vehicles as part of his ambitious agenda to combat climate change and reduce US carbon emissions. However, the EV market is facing challenges, with high-interest rates dampening customer demand for all vehicles, not just EVs.

Experts have pointed out that transitioning to an EV will be expensive for a few years, as they are a “brand new technology” and necessitate a shift in people’s relationship with their vehicles, which has remained largely unchanged for decades. The expectation that this transition would proceed seamlessly is unrealistic.

EVs are not the only way ahead

Toyoda of Toyota who has long been a skeptic of the electric vehicle (EV) hype, has recently gained validation for his reservations. Toyoda has consistently challenged the prevailing notion that EVs represent the sole path to achieving carbon neutrality in the automotive industry.

He has maintained that “There are many ways to climb the mountain” in addressing environmental concerns. Notably, other major automakers are also scaling back their EV initiatives, with Lucid reducing production by 30 per cent and GM delaying the introduction of the Chevy Silverado EV by a year.

The search for other alternatives

In contrast to the EV-focused strategy of some automakers, Toyoda has consistently recommended hedging bets by continuing to invest in hybrids, hydrogen-powered vehicles, and other eco-friendly alternatives. Ford has also taken a cautious approach, slowing production of its F-150 Lightning pickup, with Bill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, describing the discourse surrounding EVs as “heavily politicized.”

General Motors, despite ambitious commitments to phase out gas and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035, has announced a slowdown in EV production, citing drops in demand and pressures from auto strikes.
