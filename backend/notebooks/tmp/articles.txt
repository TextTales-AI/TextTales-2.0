Did Microsoft Waste $69 Billion on Activision Blizzard?
********
After nearly two years of regulatory proceedings, Microsoft (MSFT 0.36%) finally completed the acquisition of leading game producer Activision Blizzard. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority was the final holdout, but it granted approval of the deal in October.

The $68.7 billion acquisition is one of the largest in Microsoft's history. In exchange, the Xbox business gains an infusion of $8.7 billion in revenue from best-selling titles, including Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, in addition to some valuable mobile franchises, such as King's Candy Crush.

However, Microsoft didn't get everything it wanted. To get approval, it had to make some compromises. In July, Microsoft agreed to make one of the all-time best-selling franchises, Call of Duty, available to Sony and Nintendo's game consoles for 10 years.

It also agreed to let Ubisoft Entertainment buy Activision's cloud gaming rights. This means all the cloud gaming rights for Activision's PC and console content produced over the next 15 years will be owned by Ubisoft.

These compromises were needed to win the prize, but can Microsoft still reap enough growth out of Activision to justify the steep price tag?

Microsoft is building a large base of players

This won't be Microsoft's last acquisition of a video game company. Sony and Microsoft have been in an arms race to acquire studios in recent years to gain scale in the $200 billion video game industry. Microsoft previously paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda Softworks owner ZeniMax Media in 2020, so it's not surprising to see Microsoft swing for the fences with billions in cash resources.

Still, given the size of this transaction, shareholders will want to see good returns on this investment, especially after Microsoft just spent most of the $111 billion in cash and short-term investments it spent the last 30 years accumulating on its balance sheet.

Microsoft's gaming business just became one of the largest in the world. In fiscal 2023 (which ended in June), Microsoft's gaming revenue came to $15.5 billion, according to Statista estimates. Activision will add $8.7 billion to that total to bring Microsoft's gaming revenue to over $23 billion.

Activision will also contribute roughly $2.4 billion of free cash flow. But that means Microsoft paid a high price-to-free cash flow multiple of 28, which is expensive considering Activision's growth.

Over the last 10 years, Activision grew revenue by just 4.5% per year, with free cash flow growing 5.3% annually. Unless Microsoft can squeeze more growth out of this business, it might have overpaid.

When Microsoft originally announced the deal in January 2022, it spent as much time talking about the opportunity to expand into mobile gaming -- a $92 billion market -- as it did about cloud gaming opportunities. Although it doesn't have exclusive cloud gaming rights to Activision's future content, it should be able to grow Xbox Game Pass, which had 25 million subscribers in early 2022.

Game Pass has trailed Sony's 47 million subscribers in PS Plus, according to Statista. However, Microsoft now has a large pool of 356 million monthly active users to market new games and content to. This will satisfy one of Microsoft's top priorities, which is to build a community of players and increase the time players spend across a large portfolio of games. Those are the key ingredients that will create profitable growth opportunities in the video game industry.

Another overlooked opportunity for Microsoft is access to the intellectual property Activision has released going back to the 1980s. Microsoft will look to mine Activision's library for titles it can revive, and perhaps turn into valuable mobile properties. One that stands out is Guitar Hero, which Xbox head Phil Spencer has previously said he wants to revisit. Activision discontinued this franchise years ago, but the advantage of being part of Microsoft is that Activision can now take risks it couldn't before.

To answer the original question, no, I don't believe Microsoft wasted its cash. At least, it's too early to make that call. If Microsoft can help Activision release more new games at a faster pace and innovate with new ideas, the growth it could generate would go a long way toward justifying the cost of the acquisition. Depending on how much profit it can squeeze out of these franchises, this deal could look like a great value in a few years from now.

Microsoft Now Owns Activision Blizzard: What It Means for Your Favorite Games
********
From Azeroth to Pandaria, from the Dry Steppes of Sanctuary all the way to Candy Kingdom, the world of Activision Blizzard just got even bigger.

If, like me, you've played the classic Blizzard games endlessly on PC, Microsoft has potentially game-changing (literally) news for you: You'll soon be able to access these classic games in more formats and places.

The biggest gaming news of the year came on Friday the 13th, when Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of gaming studio Activision Blizzard finally closed, with the mammoth gaming studio joining the Xbox team along with popular franchises Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft.

"Today we begin a new chapter as we officially become a part of the Microsoft family, uniting with the amazing Xbox team and co-creating the future of gaming together," Activision Blizzard wrote on Oct. 13. "To the reapers, fighters, rogues, and airstrikers, The sharpshooters, revivers, healers, and bubble bursters, Sorcerers, shamans, slayers and survivors, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for playing with us."

It was something of an epic quest just for Microsoft to get here in the first place. The acquisition, announced in January 2022, faced resistance across the world, with regulators in the US, the EU, the UK and New Zealand concerned that it would lead to a lack of competition in the gaming sector, as it would put Microsoft into the mix of the top three video game publishers in the world along with Tencent and Sony.

There's a lot that will happen because of this deal, both within Activision Blizzard and with the games it produces, the cloud-streaming subscription services that'll get access to those games and whether Sony and Nintendo benefit from this. I'm here to walk you through what we know, what we don't know yet and what we can wish for.

Ready Player One (and two) on PS5 and Nintendo

To get the acquisition through, Microsoft promised not to lock down Activision Blizzard games to its Xbox consoles. This suggestion of more cross-console compatibility also means lovers of the PC games from Blizzard may soon be able to play in other places.

While I'm hopeful that StarCraft II will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch or PlayStation 5 so I can resume losing 2v2 battles online, it's mostly unknown exactly which games will be added to which consoles.

We can rest assured, though, that Call of Duty will be staying on the PlayStation platform under a 10-year "binding agreement" between Microsoft and Sony as confirmed by Xbox boss Phil Spencer in July. Through a cloud gaming deal with Ubisoft, Activision games could also be coming to the PS5 through the Ubisoft Plus streaming service.

Microsoft had earlier reached a 10-year deal to bring the Call of Duty series to Nintendo consoles. It's unknown yet if any other games will be coming to the Switch.

There's also a 10-year deal to keep Call of Duty on Valve's Steam service, but questions remain on whether it'll come to the Steam Deck handheld console.

Activision Blizzard games on streaming services

Another of Microsoft's big promises when pushing through the acquisition was that it would bring the games acquired to streaming services, negating the need for you to buy physical copies of the games in favor of just downloading them right onto your PC or console. There are already multiple ways this will happen.

First, Xbox has started work on bringing Activision, Blizzard and King game franchises to Xbox Game Pass "and other platforms," with an update on the process expected in the months ahead.

Second, Microsoft sold cloud streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft in August as part of an agreement to get the acquisition approved by the UK regulatory authority, in an effort to bypass concerns over creating an anti-competitive gaming market.

The deal with Ubisoft contains "perpetual cloud streaming rights for Call of Duty and all other current Activision Blizzard games and those released over the next 15 years," Ubisoft said on Oct.13. Ubisoft has the rights to license the games individually to third-party streaming providers as well.

Third, Microsoft made a 10-year agreement with Nvidia earlier this year to allow continued access to Xbox games on the GeForce Now cloud gaming platform and to add in Activision Blizzard games once the acquisition was approved.

Last, if you live in the European Economic Area, Microsoft is required to allow any cloud streaming service to license Activision games for free so players who own copies of those games can play for free.

A gamer's game changer

It's not just the Blizzard worlds and Call of Duty mega franchise. Microsoft now also owns console darling Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, the King's Quest reboot on PC and mobile juggernaut Candy Crush Saga.

Before now, Microsoft hasn't been much involved in the mobile gaming space, but Candy Crush, the third highest-grossing mobile game worldwide in 2023, changes that.

And by acquiring Activision Blizzard's suite of PC games, Microsoft will become more competitive with the Epic Games Store and Valve's Steam, as it will have both the Microsoft Store and Blizzard.net. Games like World of Warcraft have a huge, loyal customer base -- the MMORPG is estimated to have 130 million subscribers and 1.2 million daily players this month -- that now transfers to Microsoft.

Looking forward, as the studio no doubt has multiple games -- including an unnamed Survival game -- in the works, Microsoft likely has its own ideas of what it wants developed, expanded or scrapped.

Judging by the games featured in a trailer announcing the acquisition's closure, Microsoft is especially interested in Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Crash Bandicoot, Candy Crush, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Spyro.

IDC gaming analyst Lewis Ward told CNET he thinks it's unlikely Microsoft will change Activision Blizzard's roadmap right out of the gate, sticking with the studio's plans through 2024 at least. But he believes the exit of current CEO Bobby Kotick "will help lift a cloud from the Activision Blizzard brand."

"The acquisition could even breathe new life into smaller games and older franchises like Crash Bandicoot, Hearthstone, Spyro and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater because they may fill a hole in the Game Pass lineup," Ward added.

From a development perspective, the acquisition has the potential to prevent indie games from being made. It's likely Microsoft would focus its budget on pushing in-house content into its Game Pass service rather than giving smaller indie studios the budget to develop their own games for Xbox, Ward says.

Expanding Game Pass may become a primary driver for whatever Microsoft decides to do next with the newly acquired games.

"It's likely that larger undisclosed titles, especially if they are reboots or sequels, have been in the works and will continue to receive support and prioritization under Microsoft, especially if those games will bolster player adoption of Microsoft's Game Pass," a board member of the International Game Developers Association, who asked that we not use their name, told CNET.

Changes to gaming culture

Stepping back from the games themselves for a moment, let's hope that Microsoft has a positive impact across the workplace culture inside Activision Blizzard. The gaming studio has faced accusations of fostering a toxic "frat boy" atmosphere, in an ongoing lawsuit brought by the state of California (Activision has countersued). A labor union has filed a complaint over alleged intimidation.

In 2021, Activision Blizzard agreed to pay $18 million to settle a lawsuit from the US Equal Employment Opportunity over allegations of sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination and retaliation, with former CEO J. Allen Brack stepping down and more than 20 workers being fired.

Microsoft's 2022 diversity report cites women as making up 30.7% of its workforce. Activision Blizzard's sits at 25% as of the end of 2022. While employee numbers are an indication of diversity efforts, they don't tell the whole story: The environment in which people work is also critical for making impactful, inclusive games in 2023 and ahead.

When announcing the acquisition in January 2022, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella discussed how he had shifted Microsoft's intensely competitive inner workings, and said Spencer would do the same within Activision Blizzard.

"The culture of our organization is my No. 1 priority," Nadella said at the time. "We are supportive of the goals and the work Activision Blizzard is doing and we also recognize that after the close, we will have significant work to do in order to continue to build a culture where everyone can do their best work."

Microsoft's Activision Blizzard roster of games

For the record, here are all the Activision Blizzard gaming series now owned by Microsoft:

PC and console games from Blizzard:

Warcraft

World of Warcraft

Overwatch

Hearthstone

Diablo

Heroes of the Storm

StarCraft 2

Console games from Activision:

Blossom Blast

The continued rise of Xbox

Microsoft's various 10-year deals with competitors mean there will be no immediate impacts of the acquisition on Sony's PlayStation or in the Nintendo space. But over time, it's likely to benefit Microsoft in the console wars.

"If you think about it, Sony's customers will now be paying Microsoft to play CoD and all those other franchises," IDC's Ward said. "It's just a huge sea change in terms of the flow of money, and potentially some customer-related information, moves around the gaming ecosystem."

Activision Blizzard's exit from being an independent studio to become part of the Microsoft empire will have far-reaching consequences across all gaming platforms worldwide: mobile, PC, consoles and streaming.

Whether our favorite games are rebooted, scrapped or greenlit, Microsoft now wields much greater power to decide how, where and what we play.

Xbox chief says Activision Blizzard games aren’t coming to Xbox Game Pass until 2024
********
Xbox chief and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has confirmed that Activision Blizzard games aren’t coming to Xbox Game Pass anytime soon. In the latest official Xbox podcast, Spencer confirms there’s not going to be a big drop of Activision Blizzard games into Xbox Game Pass in the coming weeks and that we won’t see any until 2024.

Here’s what Spencer had to say:

The regulatory process took so long... that we weren’t able to get in and work with the Activision Blizzard on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, we’re starting that work, but there is work. I think the Activision Twitter handle... did put out something that talked about 2024, and I think that’s accurate. I would love it if there was some kind of secret celebration drop that’s coming in the next couple of weeks — there’s not.

Activision Blizzard posted on X (formerly Twitter), ahead of the Microsoft deal closing, that Modern Warfare III and Diablo IV both wouldn’t be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year. But it wasn’t clear about the status of older Activision Blizzard games until Phil Spencer’s clarification today.

“I know there will be some disappointment about that,” admits Spencer. “This acquisition is definitely long-term, so the fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future. And I just want to be straight with people that that’s where we are.”

Many Xbox fans had expected Microsoft to drop older versions of Call of Duty onto Xbox Game Pass almost immediately. Windows Central reported last week that it expected to “see a ton of new games hit Xbox Game Pass the very minute the deal is finalized,” but that never materialized.

Some of the expectation for Xbox Game Pass additions was based on the way Microsoft dropped 20 Bethesda games into Game Pass just two days after its acquisition closed. Microsoft also went out of its way to fix classic Xbox 360 Call of Duty titles in July, just ahead of the original Activision Blizzard deal deadline. Players had been complaining for years about not being able to matchmake in games like Call of Duty: Black Ops and the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and this suddenly got fixed by Microsoft over the summer.

Phil Spencer Discusses The Future of Activision Blizzard King Following Acquisition
********
Microsoft recently completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, meaning that the Xbox brand now owns iconic franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, and Starcraft. While this is incredibly exciting for some gamers, it has also left a lot of questions regarding the future of the IPs and how Microsoft will navigate this acquisition in regards to exclusivity, and the vast library making its way to Xbox Game Pass, which recently surpassed 30 million subscribers.

During a sit-down interview on the official Xbox YouTube channel, Phil Spencer discussed the future of Activision Blizzard King following its recent acquisition by Microsoft which was finalized earlier this month. With the acquisition of such a large publisher, the possibilities are endless regarding what Microsoft and the Xbox brand could do to capitalize on them now owning some of gaming’s IPs. Still, Phil Spencer appears to be more conservative regarding making the most of what Microsoft now owns.

ABK’s Future On Xbox Game Pass

With such an expansive library at Microsoft’s fingertips now, the thought of Activision Blizzard King games making their way to Xbox Game Pass is very exciting, but Phil Spencer has confirmed that no ABK games will be appearing on Game Pass until 2024 saying,

“This acquisition is definitely long-term. So the fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping into Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future.”

This was expected as with the Bethesda acquisition it did take a while before many of its games made their way to Game Pass. It is also worth noting that hearing the word “2024” makes it seem like it will be a long time before we get to see franchises such as Call of Duty on Game Pass, but the new year is only a couple of months away so we should begin to see Activision Blizzard King’s library trickle onto the subscription services in the coming months.

Will Call Of Duty Receive Exclusive Content On Xbox?

Understandably, one of the biggest questions that has been asked throughout the acquisition is “What does this mean for the future of Call of Duty?” As we’ve seen with games such as Starfield bypassing Sony’s PlayStation after initially being announced, it is understandable that many saw the move as a way to drive players away from the PlayStation to the Xbox ecosystem in order to play the most popular first-person shooter franchise. Phil Spencer has confirmed that the goal is 100% parity when it comes to Call of Duty and making sure that whether you’re on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, or even Nintendo, no content is exclusive to a specific platform.

“We have no goal of somehow trying to use Call of Duty to get you to buy an Xbox console.”

Could We See Old IPs Come Back In The Future?

With such an expansive history of IPs, many gamers are wondering what the acquisition could mean in terms of bringing some beloved franchises back. Some notable IPs that have become moments in time include the likes of Spyro’s Skylanders spin-off series, Guitar Hero, Tony Hawk, and The Lost Vikings. It is possible that we could see some of these return in the future, but Phil Spencer stated that they would have to be done by passionate teams that want to make a difference rather than being motivated by financial gains.

“I want to make sure that when we’re going back and visiting something, that we do it with our complete ability– a motivated team that wants to go work on something and make a difference, not just create something for financial gain, or create something for a PR announcement and not deliver on the product.”

Tony Hawk’s 1+2 Remastered saw the first two games in the series return in 2020 to huge fanfare, which left many confused when a sequel was seemingly canceled. There have also been discussions on social media among gamers about the possibility of Guitar Hero returning. It would be interesting to see whether Activision Blizzard King could recapture the magic of the early games, but its main competitor Rock Band is still active with new weekly content for Rock Band 4, so there is at least some level of demand still there for a new game.

It will be an interesting time over the coming years to see how Microsoft capitalizes on the acquisition and whether it turns out to be a good thing for the company and for gamers alike.

Microsoft spent two years trying to buy Santa Monica based Activision Blizzard. For Xbox CEO, that was the easy part
********
Listen to this post

After two years co-piloting the biggest acquisition in video game history past an onslaught of challenges, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer now moves on to his next quest: making Microsoft’s takeover of Santa Monica’s Activision Blizzard worth the hassle.

Microsoft, which owns the Xbox gaming system, closed its $69 billion deal to buy game-maker Activision Blizzard on Friday after fending off global opposition from antitrust regulators and rivals.

It marks a career-defining moment for Spencer, who first joined Microsoft as an intern in 1988 and has helmed Xbox since 2014. After years of lagging behind rival Sony’s PlayStation, acquiring Activision’s collection of popular game titles gives Microsoft a rare chance to catch up.

“His job really just starts today,” said analyst Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson, after the deal’s closure. “All he’s been doing is preparing for today where he actually gets to integrate the business.”

And it marks the end of an era for Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who’s led the Southern California maker of Call of Duty and other blockbuster franchises since 1991 after helping to buy it from bankruptcy. Kotick said he’s assisting with the transition until the end of the year.

Activision Blizzard was still reeling from worker protests, lawsuits and government investigations over allegations of workplace harassment against women and unequal pay when Microsoft privately reached out about buying the company in 2021.

When the companies announced a planned merger in January 2022, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made clear it would be “critical for Activision Blizzard to drive forward” on its commitments to improve its workplace culture.

That was just the start of Microsoft’s challenges in bringing home the deal. After negotiations with Spencer faltered, top rival Sony brought its concerns about losing access to the Call of Duty franchise to regulators around the world. The strongest opposition came from U.S. antitrust enforcers emboldened by President Joe Biden’s administration to take a tougher look at big tech deals, as well as their counterparts in the United Kingdom who finally relented in approving the deal Friday only after Microsoft agreed to make concessions.

“Microsoft didn’t have a choice. If they wanted to be long-term competitive with Sony and the PlayStation platform, they need to have a much more robust content offering,” Luria said.

But, “in retrospect, they should have read the writing on the wall in terms of the difficulty of closing the deal,” Luria said. “They needed to do the deal to stay competitive, but knowing what they know now, they might have done it differently.”

A key moment came in June, when a federal judge weighed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s attempt to block the merger while it awaited further review. In an unusual move for a CEO that telegraphed the deal’s importance, Spencer spent the better part of two weeks at the defendant table of a San Francisco courtroom conferring with Microsoft’s lawyers. The judge eventually dismissed the FTC’s request, though the agency is still seeking to unwind the deal.

Microsoft’s success in integrating Activision’s business is “not guaranteed, especially as its track record with acquisitions has been a mixed bag,” said George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst at research and advisory firm Omdia. Last year, Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks, maker of Elder Scrolls and Fallout.

Microsoft’s two key game launches this year from its Bethesda merger, Redfall and Starfield, have “been met with mixed reactions at best,” Jijiashvili said. “However, with globally popular game franchises such as Call of Duty now under its wing, the company is strategically much better positioned.”

Another challenge for Microsoft will be overcoming the workforce challenges that dogged Activision before the takeover.

As of late last year, Activision Blizzard had 13,000 employees, about 72% in North America, according to a regulatory filing. Microsoft has already pledged it will stay neutral if the nearly 10,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada seek to organize into a labor union, part of a 2022 agreement with the Communications Workers of America meant to address U.S. political concerns about the merger’s effects.

“It is a new day for workers at Activision Blizzard,” said CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. in a statement Friday.

“Over two years ago, workers at Activision Blizzard’s studios captured the country’s attention through walkouts and other protests over discrimination, sexual harassment, pay inequity, and other issues they were facing on the job,” Cummings Jr. said. “Their efforts to form unions were met with illegal retaliation and attempts to delay and block union elections. Now these workers are free to join our union through a fair process, without interference from management.”

In a Friday welcome email to Activision employees, Spencer said he wanted to “reiterate that we hold ourselves to a high bar in delivering the most inclusive and welcoming experiences for players, creators, and employees.”

Microsoft to begin “doubling down” on games following acquisition of Activision, CEO says
********
Following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, has revealed that the company is “looking forward to really doubling down both as a game producer and a publisher”.

In an interview with Axel Springer (via Insider) , Nadella was asked about the importance of the deal being approved, and he spoke about the company being able to make a “real contribution” to consumer markets.

“When I think about Microsoft, I think of perhaps developer tools, proprietary software, and gaming. Those are three things that we've done from the very beginning,” Nadella explained. “And so, to us, gaming is the one place where we think we have a real contribution to make in consumer markets.

“If I look at it, the amount of time people allocate to gaming is going up and Gen Z is going to do more of that. The way games are made, the way the games are delivered, is changing radically. Whether it's mobile, or consoles, or PCs, or even the cloud,” he continued. “So, we're looking forward to really doubling down both as a game producer and a publisher. Now we'll be one of the largest game publishers and also as a company that's building platforms for it.”

Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision was officially closed earlier this month , following the UK regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, giving its approval to an amended version of the deal. It blocked the original deal over concerns that it could harm competition in cloud gaming in the UK, but Microsoft addressed this by stating that it will sell the cloud streaming rights for current and new Activision games (releasing across the next 15 years) to Ubisoft.

In a statement released when the deal was closed, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said: "Today we start the work to bring beloved Activision, Blizzard, and King franchises to Game Pass and other platforms. We’ll share more about when you can expect to play in the coming months. We know you’re excited – and we are too."

After blockbuster Microsoft deal, gaming giants are still sitting on $45 billion cash hoard
********

Publicly listed gaming companies are sitting on a $45 billion pile of cash and cash equivalents — and that could lead to greater consolidation in the $188 billion video games market, according to a new report from venture capital firm Konvoy, which was shared exclusively with CNBC. The likes of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts , Singapore's Sea , Japan's Nintendo and Bandai Namco , South Korea's Nexon , and China's NetEase , currently hold $45.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according Konvoy, which cited these companies' latest public reports.

Public gaming companies currently hold cash and cash equivalents of $45.1 billion, according to a report from venture capital firm Konvoy. Konvoy

That would give them more than enough financial firepower to look at potential acquisition targets that could help them build out their intellectual property and products. In particular, gaming firms are looking to keep gamers more engaged for longer with live-service games that add more content over time and paid subscription packages that offer a certain amount of free games and access to cloud gaming, or the ability to play games via the cloud rather than downloading them to their machines. Publicly listed gaming companies had a fairly rosy year in 2023, on the whole. The VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF , which seeks to track MVIS Global Video Gaming & eSports Index, has climbed 20% in the year to date, according to Konvoy. The blue-chip S&P 500 index, by contrast, has climbed close to 12% year to date.

The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF , which aims to track a modified market-cap-weighted global index of companies in video games and esports, hasn't performed as well, slipping 0.4% since the start of 2023.

Big Tech eyes video games

Big Tech firms are also primed with plenty of cash to consider more gaming deals, according to Konvoy. The VC firm said that the world's biggest tech firms which includes Amazon , Microsoft , Google, Apple , Meta , Netflix , China's Tencent , and Japan's Sony , have a combined $229.4 billion of cash on their balance sheets to deploy on potential deals.

Josh Chapman, a partner at Konvoy, said the company expects the Microsoft-Activision deal — which saw the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant pay $69 billion for U.S. game publisher Activision Blizzard — would likely lead to further mergers and acquisition activity and create a new generation of gaming companies. "As active gaming investors, we believe that gamers and gaming startups stand to benefit from the deal as it improves the value-proposition for gamers and leads to a vibrant M&A environment for other deals to get closed," Chapman told CNBC in emailed comments. Cloud gaming is a key area for Microsoft as it brings Activision into its growing portfolio of game publishers. The company is pushing its cloud gaming service, which does away with the need for traditional consoles likes its Xbox Series X or Sony's PlayStation 5, with its Xbox Game Pass subscription product. Chapman said this would lead to "new opportunities for emerging game developers, infrastructure companies and gaming platforms." Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of Activision Blizzard was approved by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority earlier this month. The deal, valued at $69 billion, will see Microsoft gain ownership of some of the most lucrative properties in video games, including the massive Call of Duty franchise, Candy Crush, Crash Bandicoot, Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch.

VC deal slump

Venture capital investment into video game firms slumped 64% year over year in the third quarter of 2023, according to Konvoy's report.

Total venture funding into the video games industry in the third quarter of 2023 fell 9% quarter-over-quarter, to $454 million. Konvoy

It's a sign of how, despite the boost to the industry from Microsoft's landmark deal, the boom times for the industry in 2020 and 2021 have ebbed. Gaming startups raised a combined $454 million globally for the three months to September, down 9% quarter over quarter and more than 64% from the same three-month period a year ago.

Still, Konvoy's Chapman anticipates the picture for gaming VCs and startups will look brighter next year, as grim venture investing conditions start to improve — however, funding for gaming firms has returned to a " sustainable new normal" that will continue at the current pace for the next few years. "As the global venture market rebounds we expect gaming, which was somewhat insulated from the initial impact of the economic downturn, to follow," Chapman told CNBC. "We anticipate gaming VC funding to see a slight uptick over the next few quarters, when the industry will grow at a similar rate to before the pandemic." "Right now, VC deal volume and funding are comparable to pre-pandemic levels, and while we may not see the exponential growth of 2021, we're excited to see a stable venture funding market in gaming for continued value creation in the industry."

Tougher times

Video game publishers have been grappling with a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, with high inflation and rising interest rates denting consumer appetite for discretionary spending. Whereas in 2020, when consumers were flush with cash thanks to easy monetary conditions, times have gotten tougher in 2022 and 2023 as central bankers have increased interest rates in a bid to stem rising prices. Still, the video game player base continues to increase, with a worldwide player base of 3.381 million today, according to Konvoy. The video game market is still massive, and is projected to reach $188 billion in overall sales in 2023, according to Konvoy. That figure is up a modest 3% from the previous year, when gaming sales totaled $183 billion. But growth has accelerated slightly from 2022, when gaming sales rose only 2%. That came after the standout year of 2021. Gaming revenue reached $180 billion that year, climbing more than 8% from $166 billion in 2020 I assume, according to Konvoy's research. In 2020, the industry saw even bigger growth — more than 9% year over year. That was when pandemic lockdowns were in full swing, and people had more time to spend playing video games indoors. Konvoy is projecting long-term growth for the games industry in the coming years, though. The firm said that it expects a compound annual growth rate of 9% in the next five years, with the industry reaching a whopping $288 billion in overall sales by 2028.

Oct 19 (Reuters) - Champagne corks may have been popping in Redmond, Washington, last week after Microsoft (MSFT.O) closed its $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.MX), but the tech giant’s fight with U.S. antitrust regulators isn’t over yet.

Although the Federal Trade Commission to date has lost every attempt to halt the merger, the antitrust enforcer isn’t stepping down. Agency lawyers are set to appear before a federal appeals court in December to argue the deal is anticompetitive, while also prepping for an in-house administrative trial further down the road.

Back in the day, I wrote about antitrust litigation as a reporter, and the Microsoft-Activision tie-up got me thinking about another hotly contested deal I covered.

In 2008, the FTC scored a narrow appellate win in challenging Whole Foods’ $565 million acquisition of rival grocer Wild Oats -- a decision that came nearly a year after the two supermarket chains had consummated their merger, and one that forced Whole Foods into a costly settlement.

Could something similar happen to Microsoft and Activision?

Probably not, said now-retired Dechert partner Paul Denis, who was Whole Foods' lead lawyer.

To be sure, the FTC litigates just a handful of merger cases each year, and each one plays out differently.

For example, the agency is currently deep in litigation against Illumina over the company's already-consummated acquisition of cancer detection test maker Grail.

The Whole Foods case also had unique appellate quirks that are unlikely to be duplicated -- but procedurally, the Microsoft case has been unfolding in a strikingly similar way.

The Microsoft challenge “feels very familiar,” Denis told me. “The FTC is clearly trying to plow some new ground -- as they attempted with Whole Foods and now with Microsoft” in pursuing aggressive theories of antitrust enforcement.

Microsoft, which already made significant concessions to win approval from competition regulators in Britain and Europe, says the Activision merger will benefit consumers and the video game industry by bringing “more games to more people.”

A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment directly on the litigation, but President Brad Smith in a blog post noted the company has garnered friend-of-the-court support from antitrust scholars, economists and former government officials, as well as business and labor groups – “an almost unprecedented range of diverse parties,” Smith wrote.

The agency is undeterred. “The FTC continues to believe this deal is a threat to competition,” spokesperson Victoria Graham said via email. “We remain focused on the federal appeal process despite Microsoft and Activision closing their deal.”

The FTC asserts that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, which makes the wildly popular “Call of Duty” series, would enable the combined company “to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription and cloud-gaming business.”

As it did with Whole Foods 16 years ago, the FTC filed what’s known as a Part 3 administrative complaint to block the merger, arguing the tie-up would stifle competition and harm consumers.

Agency lawyers in both cases also sued the companies in federal court, seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the deals from being consummated pending resolution of the slower-moving administrative action.

And in both cases, the FTC was soundly defeated in district court.

As San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in siding with Microsoft wrote in a 53-page opinion in July, the FTC “has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim” that the merger may substantially lessen competition. If anything, she found, the “evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.”

In the Whole Foods case, the FTC unsuccessfully argued that the grocer, which at the time had 194 stores, would gain a near-monopoly in the “premium, natural and organic supermarket” category by acquiring 110 stores from Wild Oats.

Whole Foods, which was subsequently bought by Amazon in 2017, did not respond to a request for comment.

The FTC in each instance appealed its losses, but failed to win emergency injunctions from higher courts that would freeze the mergers while litigation was pending.

Both Microsoft and Whole Foods then went on to close their deals, apparently gambling the FTC was a paper tiger and they’d live happily ever after in post-merger bliss.

For Whole Foods, it didn’t quite work out that way.

The original trio of D.C. Circuit judges that rebuked the FTC’s bid for an emergency stay had changed, with Judge Janice Rogers Brown replacing Judge David Sentelle.

The substitution proved fateful, Denis said. In a surprise move, the court in a 2-1 decision remanded the case for further consideration, with Brown writing that the lower court judge didn’t focus enough on how the merger might affect Whole Foods’ “core” customers.

At that point, it made little business sense for Whole Foods to keep fighting, not with the threat of drawn-out a Part 3 trial hanging over its head – a process which by statute is only available to the FTC, not the Justice Department. The two agencies share responsibility for antitrust enforcement, but DOJ is confined to litigating in federal court -- but that’s another column.

“Whole Foods ended up having to settle,” Denis said, agreeing in 2009 to divest 32 stores and the Wild Oats brand name.

It was a possibility the company had “war-gamed out” ahead of time, he said. As a horizontal merger between direct competitors, such divestitures are the usual fix to mollify regulators.

The Microsoft-Activision case is a vertical merger, however, where the companies operate in the same industry but provide different services. That can make it harder to predict what concessions would satisfy regulators, Denis said.

Microsoft is represented by Wilkinson Stekloff; Weil Gotshal & Manges; and Sidley Austin, with Activision turning to Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom.

As my Reuters colleagues reported, Microsoft agreed to sell the non-European streaming rights to Activision’s games to Ubisoft Entertainment to assuage concerns by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, which approved the merger on Oct. 13.

The FTC said it’s still weighing these concessions.

The new Ubisoft agreement, agency spokesperson Graham said, “presents a whole new facet to the merger that will affect American consumers, which the FTC will assess as part of its ongoing administrative proceeding.”

40 studios to rule them all: inside Microsoft Gaming divisions post-Activision Blizzard deal
********
Now that Activision Blizzard has joined Microsoft, it has one of the most impressive portfolios of game studios in the industry. Let’s take a closer look at all of its development and publishing subsidiaries, as well as their key IPs.

Since Phil Spencer took over Xbox, Microsoft’s gaming business has expanded significantly, largely thanks to the multi-billion acquisitons of ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard (as well as a number of smaller M&A deals).

The company now owns roughly 40 subsidiaries, including game development studios, publishers, and support teams. All of them are part of the larger Microsoft Gaming organization, which is led by Spencer as CEO.

Below are Microsoft’s main first-party studios broken down into three divisions: Xbox Game Studios, ZeniMax Media, and Activision Blizzard. But keep in mind that the company is likely to make some changes to its structure after completing its latest $68.7 billion deal, which could lead to some internal mergers and even layoffs or the divestment of certain smaller assets.

Xbox Game Studios

Turn 10 Studios (established by Microsoft)

Founded : 2002

: 2002 IP : Forza Motorsport

: Forza Motorsport Games released: 9

Founded in 2001, Turn 10 is still led by its co-founder Dan Greenawalt, who also serves as general manager of the Forza Motorsport franchise. He oversaw the production of all titles in the series, including the Forza Horizon IP (developed by Playground Games).

: Halo Games released: 11

Bonnie Ross started 343 Industries in 2007, shortly after Bungie announced its split from Microsoft, to manage the further development of the Halo franchise. Since then, the studio has helped ship 11 games, including Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite.

The latter became a live service title, and 343 is now putting all its efforts into content support of the game by releasing new seasons, game modes, and (recently) the Forge AI Toolkit. However, a number of key developers have left the team since October 2020, including Bonnie Ross, art director Nicolas Bouvier, and technical director David Berger.

Originally known as Zipline Studios, it was rebranded Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver shortly after being founded in 2010. The team was assigned to the eventually canceled AAA shooter for Kinect, but was later renamed Black Tusk Studios to create a new Xbox franchise for the corporation.

In 2014, Microsoft acquired the Gears of War IP from Epic Games and put Black Tusk (this time renamed to The Coalition) in charge of the series. Since then, the studio has released Gears of War 4 and Gears 5, as well as contributed to Gears Tactics and The Matrix Awakens demo.

However, the game unfortunately got stuck in a sort of development hell. During 2021, dozens of developers left The Initiative, including core writers, designers, and game director Dan Neuburger (was in charge of several Tomb Raider games).

The studio even partnered with Crystal Dynamisc to finish Perfect Dark, but its current state is still unclear. In August 2023, IGN reported that the game is still “roughly two to three years away from being ready for release.”

Right now, the team is also helping TiMi Studio Group, a subsidiary of Tencent and developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, with Age of Empires Mobile. It is yet to be launched globally, but its Chinese version, Return to Empire, broke into the top 10 highest-grossing iOS games in the country upon its release in March 2021.

Kotick to Depart Activision Blizzard
********
Activision Blizzard Inc. said its long-serving chief executive, Bobby Kotick, will step down following the recent closure of its merger with Microsoft Inc.

Kotick has been at Activision Blizzard’s helm since its very beginning in 2008. He previously served as chief executive of video game publisher Activision Inc. from 1991 to 2008.

During that time, Activision was brought back from near bankruptcy and acquired a series of development studios. Kotick then played a crucial role in the organization and execution of a merger with the gaming division of French entertainment company Vivendi SE, including its subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment Inc. The merger closed in 2008, creating Activision Blizzard Inc., with Kotick in charge.

Since then, the Santa Monica-based company has become one of the largest and most profitable video game companies in the world, boasting iconic franchises including “Call of Duty” and “Overwatch.” The company was acquired by Microsoft this month after more than a year and a half of pushback from regulators including the Federal Trade Commission and the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority. The deal, worth a reported $68.7 billion, closed on Oct. 13.

“Combining with Microsoft will bring new resources and new opportunities to our extraordinary teams worldwide,” Kotick said in a note to employees. “It will also enable us to deliver more fun, more joy and more connection to more players than ever before.”

Kotick is the co-chairman of the Call of Duty Endowment, a nonprofit that he co-founded with Brian Kelly, the chairman of Activision Blizzard. The endowment funds organizations that help veterans find “high-quality careers” after leaving military service and promotes awareness of the value veterans bring to the workplace.

In the fall of 2021, about 1,000 Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition asking for Kotick to be removed from the company. The company previously settled cases with the Securities and Exchanges Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which alleged, respectively, that Activision failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and that it “subject(ed) employees to sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination and retaliation.” As part of the EEOC settlement, Activision created an $18 million fund for eligible claimants who claimed they experienced such conditions during their employment at Activision. The company has also expanded both its Ethics and Compliance team and its Ethics Ambassador Program.

“Brian and I couldn’t be more excited for the next chapter for Activision Blizzard,” Kotick said. “We now join one of the most successful global companies, poised for unprecedented opportunities to connect the world through our games. As a part of Microsoft, we will be even better, together.”

According to a 2022 proxy filing, Kotick is entitled to a $14.4 million payment if he departs Activision Blizzard due to a change of company control, a clause that was in his contract before the Microsoft deal began.

Xbox Partner Preview showcase announced for Wednesday The livestream will feature Alan Wake 2, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and ARK: Survival Ascended.

The season of gaming news events has come and gone, but the major players still have a couple of surprises up their sleeves before 2023 officially comes to a close. Xbox is hot off the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and will look to keep the momentum rolling with an Xbox Partner Preview showcase this week, highlighting upcoming games from third-party developers.

Microsoft announced the Xbox Partner Preview in a post to Xbox Wire. The event will take place on Wednesday, October 25, 2023. It’ll be streamed on Xbox’s YouTube and Twitch channels. This is the first installment in what is planned to be a series of livestreams that highlight games from developers outside of Microsoft’s massive stable.



Source: Remedy Entertainment

This new show format will deliver a fresh mix of indie games and familiar favorites from our third-party partners like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, Studio Wildcard, and others with more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage.

While fans are undoubtedly hungry for details about what the future holds now that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is complete, the company is telling folks not to get their hopes up. The announcement states that the “Xbox Partner Preview will not feature any additional news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related to the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard King.”

With the first Xbox Partner Preview just two days away, it’ll be interesting to see how the format works and how Microsoft looks to implement it in the future. Be sure to bookmark our Xbox topic page as we’ll be reporting any news out of the showcase right here on Shacknews.

Microsoft-Activision Takeover Emboldens Merger Arb Traders to Boost Their Bets
********
(Bloomberg) -- Traders who bet on corporate mergers and acquisitions are boosting their wagers on a slew of proposed deals, after successful trades on transactions like Microsoft Corp.’s purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. have left them with more money to invest.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of the game developer, which closed on Friday, plus Amgen Inc.’s $28 billion acquisition of drugmaker Horizon Therapeutics Plc earlier this month have also left investors with more confidence that companies can overcome the objections of the Federal Trade Commission to many corporate combinations.

The traders that wager on these deals, known as merger arbitrageurs, aren’t confident that every announced acquisition will happen, but are growing more hopeful about many.

Take Seagen Inc, the biotech firm that said in March it had agreed to sell itself to Pfizer Inc for $43 billion. Its share price has risen more than 4% since September 21 to $215, compared with the $229 cash offer, getting an extra boost in the last few months from Amgen’s success. That leaves the gap between the two prices near its narrowest level yet. Another boon for merger arb traders was Seagen’s reporting positive results from a late-stage cancer drug candidate, supporting the company’s stock price even if the acquisition doesn’t go through.

As traders plow more money into deals, they got a reminder on Tuesday of the potential risks. VMware Inc. which is going through regulatory reviews for its $69 billion takeover by Broadcom Inc., saw its shares fall as much as 12.1% after a report said Chinese regulators, one of the last remaining hurdles to the deal closing, could take longer to approve the transaction than previously expected. A spokesperson for VMware said the company continues to expect the deal to close on Oct. 30.

The difference between VMware’s share price and the value of Broadcom’s cash-and-stock offer, or the spread for deal, gapped out to more than $16 on Tuesday morning, from around $6 as of Monday’s close. Bill Gross, who has grown vocal about merger arbitrage strategy, said on Friday that the stock might have benefited from the cash freed up by the Activision purchase.

Arbs are also looking at pending transactions further down the line, especially those likely to wrap up next year. Shale oil maker Pioneer Natural Resources Co, software developer Splunk Inc. and biotechnology supplier Abcam Plc are among their popular picks, according to an informal Bloomberg news survey of five specialists.

Between the Microsoft and Amgen transactions, and recent gains on Seagen shares, the second half of the year is generating strong returns for the merger arbitrage strategy, said Aaron Glick at TD Cowen. These gains come amid relatively light acquisition volume this year, giving arbs fairly limited situations to trade in, Glick said. Year-to-date value of deals announced in North America have fallen about 22% to $810 billion from a year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Here’s a breakdown of other deals that are capturing traders’ attention:

Exxon-Pioneer

Exxon Mobil Corp. this month agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co. for $59.5 billion, the oil major’s largest takeover in more than two decades. While the deal is expected to close in the first half of 2024, a key question is whether it will face lengthy antitrust scrutiny. The Biden administration had toughened its review of oil and gas industry deals and asked FTC to investigate high gas prices. But the gap between Pioneer shares and the price Exxon’s paying, known as the spread excluding dividends, is just about $7 as of Monday’s close. That amounts to a difference of 2.7%, signaling investor optimism that the deal will be completed.

Cisco-Splunk

Cisco Systems Inc. in September said it plans to buy Splunk in a deal valued at about $28 billion. It represents the networking giant’s biggest acquisition yet and a massive push into software and artificial intelligence-powered data analysis. Cisco CEO believed the transaction would close within nine to 12 months. Splunk’s shares were at $148.25 at Monday’s close, about 5.6% below the cash offer of $157, a relatively narrow spread implying that investors see a high probability of the transaction closing.

Danaher-Abcam

Danaher Corp. said it’s buying Abcam, a maker of laboratory products including immune proteins used in drug discovery, for $5.7 billion in August. The deal is expected to close in mid-2024. One wrinkle is the company’s founder, Jonathan Milner, who’s been trying to persuade investors to reject the bid. He owns about a 6.2% stake. But top Abcam holder HBK Capital, which has amassed a 7.5% stake, has voiced support. Abcam’s shares rose 1.55% to close at $22.96 on Monday, about 4.3% below the $24 offer.

Microsoft/Activision Blizzard

Last Friday, Microsoft completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, paving the way for the implementation of CWA’s groundbreaking labor neutrality agreement for workers at the company. Thousands of video game workers will now have a free and fair process for joining CWA.

“It is a new day for workers at Activision Blizzard,” said CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. “Over two years ago, workers at Activision Blizzard’s studios captured the country’s attention through walkouts and other protests over discrimination, sexual harassment, pay inequity, and other issues they were facing on the job. Their efforts to form unions were met with illegal retaliation and attempts to delay and block union elections. Now these workers are free to join our union through a fair process, without interference from management. Microsoft’s high-road approach should be the norm across the industry.”

Perhaps it’s finally time for Spyro the Dragon to get a new game — Crash Bandicoot got one, it’s only fair. Maybe Phil Spencer can smooth over the bad blood with Tony Hawk and get the Pro Skater series back onto the development half pipe? And let’s not forget Blizzard, who are apparently using the legendary StarCraft series as a drinks coaster around the office. Let’s dust that one off too.But even before the Activision deal, Microsoft has been sitting on a dragon’s hoard of IP from their past that we’d love to see come back.

Diablo 4 Season 2 is set to bring with it the 'Season of Blood' as the game welcomes vampires alongside its launch on Steam. Just in time for Halloween, the vampire-themed content is perfect for a spooky October.

The Mirror reports the second of Diablo 4's quarterly updates kicks off this week, with the Diablo 4 Season 2 patch notes being revealed earlier this month. Unlike the 'disastrous' launch of Diablo 4 Season 1 which caused fan backlash, Diablo 4 Season 2 should hopefully bring the game back to its former glory.

Diablo 4 Season 2 also marks the release of the game on Steam. Until recently, Blizzard titles have been exclusive to its own Battle.net service, with Overwatch 2 launching on Valve's platform back in August and subsequently became one of the worst-rated games on Steam with 90 per cent of user reviews being negative on the Overwatch 2 Steam page.

Diablo 4 Season 2 start time

Blizzard confirmed via a post on the Blizzard website that Diablo 4 Season 2 will begin on Tuesday, October 17 at 6pm BST. Unlike Diablo 4 Season 1 where Diablo 4 patch 1.1.0a launched a couple of days before Season 1 kicked off, Blizzard has confirmed that Diablo 4 patch 1.2.0 will go live on October 17 alongside the launch of the new season.

Diablo 4 Season 2 will launch mere days after Microsoft completed its $69 billion acquisition of Diablo developer Activision Blizzard.

What's new in Diablo 4 Season 2

Diablo Season 2 will introduce a vampire-themed story and new gear will be available to go alongside it. The Season of Blood isn't a full expansion, that comes next year, but will still see plenty of new content added. Polygon reports:

Vampire hunter Erys anchors a seasonal quest line that sees you fight against a vampire lord.

You can wield vampiric powers and equip gear called Pact Armor.

The Seasonal Realm will once again feature both a free and paid version of the battle pass.

Seasonal Realm Season 2 will feature the Blood Harvest Seasonal Event, which tasks you with fighting waves of vampires in specific areas of Sanctuary.

There will be five new endgame bosses, each of whom has a different resistance type.

All five classes are getting slightly tweaked.

Diablo 4 Steam release time

For the first time, Diablo 4 will be available on Steam, after being a Battle.net exclusive for four months. The Diablo 4 Steam release is set for Tuesday, October 17 at 6pm - the exact same time as Diablo 4 Season 2 launches.

Unfortunately, because the game isn't available to pre-order on Steam, there is no preload available to players. You'll need to wait until Diablo 4 launches on Steam to buy it and download the 90GB file before you can jump into Diablo 4 Season 2 (although we'd imagine you would want to play the base game first).

Microsoft is offering a free Diablo 4 trial for all Xbox players this weekend.

The timed trial is available as part of Xbox’s long-running Free Play Days promotion, which lets Game Pass subscribers try out the full versions of selected games each weekend at no additional charge.

Diablo 4 doesn’t require a Game Pass membership, but playtime is limited to 10 hours, Microsoft said.

Overwatch 2 is following Fortnite’s footsteps and holding its first-ever musical collaboration, this one with K-Pop group Le Sserafim.

Blizzard announced the collaboration with the five-member girl group, whose name is an anagram for “I’m fearless,” in an official blog post published on Wednesday. The event will see new in-game content inspired by the rising K-pop band behind hits like “FEARLESS” and “ANTIFRAGILE.”

Le Sserafim — comprised of members Kim Chaewon, Sakura, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae — will kick off their collaboration with Overwatch 2 with the release of their music video for their new single “Perfect Night,” which premieres October 26 at 9 p.m. PT. In the concept trailer for the music video, one of the members is seen wearing D.Va’s headphones. You can take a good guess who’s wearing them.

Overwatch 2 is getting a new game mode inspired by LE SSEFAFIM

On November 1, Overwatch 2 will launch a game mode inspired by Le Sserafim’s music alongside Legendary hero skins. Details on the mode and the skins will be revealed on October 30. Then the group will make an appearance at this year’s BlizzCon to perform “Perfect Night” and other songs.

“We're extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game's first musical artist collaboration,” Overwatch general manager Walter Kong wrote in a press release. “Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together.”

Overwatch 2’s first collaboration with a music group, let alone a K-Pop group, comes on the heels of its first anniversary and Microsoft finalizing its $69 billion acquisition of its parent company Activision Blizzard, placing the franchise under new ownership. What better way to celebrate Overwatch moving into its new home and the sequel’s first birthday than an in-game and real world K-Pop concert?

World of Warcraft Classic's worst Hardcore class has been revealed, and it's bad news for the MMO's Hunters
********
World of Warcraft Classic developer Blizzard has revealed the worst class to play as, and it's bad news for Hunters.

In a press release provided by the developer, Blizzard revealed what the unluckiest class is for UK players in its MMORPG. Among these stats, it was also revealed what the deadliest place to visit in World of Warcraft Classic is. Unfortunately, the statistics haven't been kind to the Hunter Class, revealing that it has the highest death percentage of any class - 41% of UK players who chose this class ended up meeting their permanent demise. "The Hunter is often seen as a safe class, but beware, as looks can be deceiving," Blizzard tells WoW players.

If you're trying to stay alive for as long as possible, it's probably a good idea to stay clear of Teldrassil, Undercity, and Stormwind as these locations - according to the UK-specific stats - caused the most deaths amongst players. Blizzard also revealed that the deadliest level for players (where they were defeated by the perils of Hardcore Realms) was at Level 6, with 10% of those not surviving past that level.

Just in case you missed it, World of Warcraft actually now belongs to Xbox's parent company after the closure of the Microsoft Activision Blizzard acquisition . Close to two years after it was first announced, Microsoft revealed on October 13 that Activision, and its subsidiaries Blizzard and King, are now part of the Xbox family. Shortly after the announcement, we got a trailer for the acquisition which saw Activision Blizzard characters from Crash Bandicoot, Overwatch, and WoW making an appearance and declaring that "this is home now."

Microsoft Stock Earnings Preview: Can MSFT Beat Estimates?
********
Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row. Will it be five?

Microsoft will report quarterly earnings on October 24 after the stock market closes at 3:05 p.m. Central Time.

The tech giant is expected to post EPS of $2.65 on $54.54 billion in revenue.

Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row.

The Activision-Blizzard acquisition has finally closed, securing Microsoft's big gaming and VR investment.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock has had a great 2023 so far, opening the year at $243.08 and sitting well above that mark at a current price of $327.

The stock is already up 35% on the year, and we've yet to approach the holiday season where new bonus money tends to hit the stock market—we'll see if the recent market selloff will scare investors away or entice them to invest in big-name tech stocks like Microsoft.

The stock price has a +-$14.68 expected move through next week based on current implied volatility, which encompasses the upcoming earnings announcement. The stock has a +-$28.04 expected move through the December monthly options cycle, which means this earnings week accounts for about half of the expected movement through nearly the rest of the year.

Bullish on Microsoft Earnings

Microsoft finally closed its $69 billion gaming deal with Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) which is the biggest gaming deal we've seen yet. It also bolstered its artificial intelligence efforts, which sets the company up for a nice positive narrative on this quarterly earnings call.

Microsoft beat earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates four quarters in a row, and revenue estimates 75% of the time during the same period. I don't see much of a negative sentiment with Microsoft earnings this time around with so much positive news, but we'll see what the market says on Tuesday.

Bearish on Microsoft Earnings

Observers have lofty expectations of a strong forecast during Microsoft's earnings call this quarter, and this shouldn't surprise anyone after the massive acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. With grand expectations come an easier path to disappointment though. If future guidance is weak and the tech giant fails to beat EPS and/or revenue expectations—or any other negative surprise becomes known—we could see this popular tech stock fall in value after the earnings announcement in this bleak stock market we've seen recently.

The Adobe exec behind the Figma deal expresses frustration over slow pace of regulatory approval
********
Adobe executive David Wadhwani wonders whether expensive technology acquisitions should take as long as they are to receive approval from government regulators, he said on Tuesday at the WSJ Tech live event in Laguna Beach, Calif.

Adobe, the maker of design software, is working to complete its $20 billion acquisition of Figma, which people use to collaborate on the design of apps and websites. The two companies announced the tie-up in 13 months ago, and they've been dealing with investigations from the U.S. Department of Justice and regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.

The comments come a week after Microsoft closed its $69 billion purchase of game publisher Activision Blizzard, nearly 21 months after disclosing plans for that deal. Microsoft lawyers dealt with pressure from the same three jurisdictions as Adobe, and they took on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission before a district court judge in San Francisco before ultimately winning approval to move forward.

Adobe has said it expects to close the Figma deal in 2023.

On Tuesday, Wadhwani, president of Adobe's digital media business that includes the subscription-based Creative Cloud, and the key executive driving the transaction, said the company now expects to hear back from regulators in the next few months. The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority says the statutory deadline for the current stage of its inquiry is Dec. 31, 2023. Adobe has agreed to pay Figma $1 billion if regulators reject the deal, or if it isn't completed by mid-March 2024.

"The question we should be asking is, should it take this long — from a regulatory process, should it take this long to have the conversations?" Wadhwani said, adding that it's important to be able to move quickly with innovation.

Tools for creative expression, documents and marketing all represent growth opportunities for Adobe, and Figma is the fourth leg of the stool, Wadhwani said.

Since revealing its intent to buy Figma, Adobe has been busy releasing and promoting tools for generative artificial intelligence that can develop images and other content in response to a few words of human input. Wadhwani said he thinks there's an opportunity for Figma to do more generative AI when it comes to automatically creating designs for software. But he said he didn't want to speak for Dylan Field, Figma's co-founder and CEO.

"We're not a combined company," Wadhwani said.

The Competition and Markets Authority has been trying to figure out if the deal would substantially lessen competition. The group found that Adobe is still offering to customers customers its XD screen-design tool that competes with Figma, even if it was put in "maintenance mode." Adobe replied that "in an innovative and dynamic market XD cannot be considered a 'material' competitor to Figma."

Nintendo Boss Comments on Microsoft Relationship Following Leaked Acquisition Email
********
Last month, a number of Microsoft's confidential emails leaked online. Among those emails was one written by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who openly spoke about a desire to see the company acquire Nintendo. In the email, Spencer laid out the logistical difficulties, but noted that "getting Nintendo would be a career moment." Since then, many have been wondering about any potential impact those comments might have on the relationship between the two companies. In an interview with Inverse, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser was asked for the first time about Spencer's comments.

"We have a great relationship with Microsoft. We consider them to be partners in many, many ways, and you only have to look at Nintendo Switch to see that partnership. Obviously, Minecraft is on Nintendo Switch, and we brought Banjo Kazooie to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. So, we're looking forward to that partnership continuing," said Bowser.

Nintendo and Microsoft

Bowser specifically mentions Minecraft on Switch and Banjo-Kazooie in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but the relationship between Nintendo and Xbox has produced even bigger results during the Switch era. While PlayStation initially fought against enabling cross-play, Microsoft and Nintendo fully embraced the option, and even participated in a marketing campaign that argued that gaming is "better together." That campaign seemed to put pressure on Sony, who eventually relented, allowing cross-play as an option in various online games, including Minecraft. The relationship between Microsoft and Nintendo even resulted in GoldenEye 007 coming to both Nintendo Switch Online and Xbox Game Pass, making the N64 classic accessible again for the first time in decades.

Xbox has always wanted to take that partnership further, but it will likely never happen. Nintendo has long had a "war chest" of funds to help them even in difficult times, and the company has had a massively successful few years. Switch continues to sell well after more than six years on the market, and Nintendo has expanded the popularity of its franchises through its partnership with Universal, which has led to The Super Mario Bros. Movie, as well as Super Nintendo World attractions at Universal Studios.

Acquisitions in the Video Game Industry

Bowser's comments were part of a broader question from Inverse about the growing trend of acquisitions in the video game industry. Over the last few years, Microsoft has spent billions to acquire both Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, and PlayStation similarly spent quite a bit on Bungie. Nintendo has been a lot more conservative about buying up studios, focusing instead on established partners like Next Level Games, the team behind Luigi's Mansion 3 and Mario Strikers: Battle League. There has been some concern about the impact of consolidation on players, but Bowser points to the growing number of new studios as a positive sign.

"As far as consolidation in the industry goes, I've been a part of this industry for 16-plus years now. One thing that's been constant is the acquisitions of studios. But the other constant is the fact that new studios are popping up every single year. Incredibly creative studios are making content, from indie-sized to AAA-sized games. So as consolidation happens, on an equal basis, we're seeing these new studios, which really just speaks to the dynamic nature of the industry overall. In the end, that bodes well for the player," Bowser told Inverse.

Microsoft Gaming CEO is not so enthusiastic on the metaverse
********
Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard was a big deal. In fact, it was such a big deal that regulators stopped the deal due to concerns it would throttle innovation and lead to less choice for gamers.

Nonetheless, despite the initial hurdles, the $69 billion deal was closed just days ago, growing Microsoft’s gaming business and providing the “building blocks of the metaverse,” as CEO Satya Nadella said when it was announced in 2022.

Yet, since then, leaked documents and public comments hint that the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, is less than enthusiastic about the metaverse. In an interview with Bloomberg, he questioned what it even is, stating his view that gamers have already been in it for 30 years.

Spencer also said he was “cautious” about play-to-earn games and called the metaverse a “poorly built videogame,” adding, “that’s just not where I want to spend most of my time.”

Clearly, the Microsoft Gaming CEO feels differently about the metaverse than Nadella, who gushed about the steps toward that the Activision acquisition took.

What is the metaverse, actually?

Most people would agree with Spencer; the metaverse is an ill-defined concept, and it’s less than inspiring in its current iterations. What started as a buzzword that got Mark Zuckerberg so excited, he renamed his company to pivot in its direction seems to have fizzled out. What we’re left with is a loose connection between virtual reality (VR), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital objects, and a few other related concepts.

Yet, the metaverse is real; it just hasn’t been built properly yet. Just as Microsoft and other giant corporations tried to develop walled gardens to control the internet, they are trying, and once again failing, to do the same for the metaverse.

In reality, just like the internet, The metaverse will be built on a stable, open protocol like the BSV blockchain. Corporations will, of course, have a presence in it, but they won’t control it. After all, a team of corporate designers and coders can never match the creativity and effort of humanity combined. BSV blockchain provides a blank slate on which anyone can draw with the added benefits of monetization through micropayments instead of the digital pollution of ads.

With BSV blockchain underpinning the metaverse, creators will be paid in real-time for access to their digital worlds via Bitcoin micropayments, digital twins of real-world locations like football stadiums and concert halls will exist, and digital items like NFTs and other tokens can be traded, exchanged, and more importantly, owned.

Perhaps, the reason Spencer is so uninspired by the metaverse is that he hasn’t understood its true potential and has only seen the limited, controlled early prototypes created by the corporation he works for. He hasn’t seen anything yet, but neither have any of us.

Metaverse is going to change the world as we know it: Dereck Hoogenkamp
