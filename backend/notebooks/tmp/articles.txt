Microsoft Successfully Completes Its Acquisition of Activision Blizzard
********
UK authorities have granted their approval for Microsoft’s colossal USD 68.7 billion deal with Activision Blizzard, following the green light from the FTC in July. This decision marks a momentous turning point in the gaming industry. As it clears the path for Ubisoft to assume control of iconic titles such as Call of Duty. Consequently, Microsoft is emerging as a global gaming powerhouse.

Microsoft Gaming’s CEO, Phil Spencer, a dedicated gamer himself, has expressed his admiration for the profound impact of Activision Blizzard and its subsidiary, King, on gaming and popular culture. Games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush Saga have enraptured millions of players worldwide.

Microsoft’s Historic Acquisition of Activision Blizzard is finally complete

Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

Ubisoft, a major player in the ever-evolving cloud gaming sphere, now possesses the perpetual cloud streaming rights for Call of Duty and other Activision Blizzard titles. This means that in the European Economic Area (EEA), which encompasses EU countries, gamers can freely stream these games.

Beyond the EEA, Ubisoft holds control over the cloud streaming rights, with the option to license them to Microsoft for Xbox Cloud Gaming. The likelihood of withholding these licenses is minimal, given that Microsoft is prepared to pay a wholesale fee for these rights.

As part of this groundbreaking deal, Activision Blizzard games will become part of Ubisoft Plus, the company’s game subscription service. While the exact timeline for full availability remains uncertain, this arrangement is set to last for 15 years. With perpetual licenses ensuring Ubisoft’s enduring control.

The gaming industry’s shift towards streaming is revolutionizing accessibility. With Ubisoft striving to make gaming as convenient as music and movie streaming. To summarize, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft’s strides in cloud gaming. And the ever-evolving gaming landscape promise to enhance the convenience and accessibility of gaming for players worldwide.

In a heartfelt email to employees, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick commented:

Today signifies a monumental moment in our company’s storied history. Our union with Microsoft will provide fresh resources and new opportunities for our exceptional teams worldwide. It will empower us to deliver more fun, more joy, and more connections to a broader player base than ever before.

This milestone is the culmination of your dedication and innovation over four decades.

Chris Early, Ubisoft’s SVP of Strategic Partnerships & Business Development, added:

Taking on these rights allows Ubisoft to introduce Activision Blizzard games like Call of Duty to Ubisoft Plus. And even grant streaming access licenses to cloud gaming companies, service providers, and console manufacturers. In doing so, we are broadening access to these games across various streaming platforms, benefiting more players than ever before.

Xbox chief says Activision Blizzard games aren’t coming to Xbox Game Pass until 2024
********
Xbox chief and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has confirmed that Activision Blizzard games aren’t coming to Xbox Game Pass anytime soon. In the latest official Xbox podcast, Spencer confirms there’s not going to be a big drop of Activision Blizzard games into Xbox Game Pass in the coming weeks and that we won’t see any until 2024.

Here’s what Spencer had to say:

The regulatory process took so long... that we weren’t able to get in and work with the Activision Blizzard on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, we’re starting that work, but there is work. I think the Activision Twitter handle... did put out something that talked about 2024, and I think that’s accurate. I would love it if there was some kind of secret celebration drop that’s coming in the next couple of weeks — there’s not.

Activision Blizzard posted on X (formerly Twitter), ahead of the Microsoft deal closing, that Modern Warfare III and Diablo IV both wouldn’t be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year. But it wasn’t clear about the status of older Activision Blizzard games until Phil Spencer’s clarification today.

“I know there will be some disappointment about that,” admits Spencer. “This acquisition is definitely long-term, so the fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future. And I just want to be straight with people that that’s where we are.”

Many Xbox fans had expected Microsoft to drop older versions of Call of Duty onto Xbox Game Pass almost immediately. Windows Central reported last week that it expected to “see a ton of new games hit Xbox Game Pass the very minute the deal is finalized,” but that never materialized.

Some of the expectation for Xbox Game Pass additions was based on the way Microsoft dropped 20 Bethesda games into Game Pass just two days after its acquisition closed. Microsoft also went out of its way to fix classic Xbox 360 Call of Duty titles in July, just ahead of the original Activision Blizzard deal deadline. Players had been complaining for years about not being able to matchmake in games like Call of Duty: Black Ops and the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and this suddenly got fixed by Microsoft over the summer.

Phil Spencer Discusses The Future of Activision Blizzard King Following Acquisition
********
Microsoft recently completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, meaning that the Xbox brand now owns iconic franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, and Starcraft. While this is incredibly exciting for some gamers, it has also left a lot of questions regarding the future of the IPs and how Microsoft will navigate this acquisition in regards to exclusivity, and the vast library making its way to Xbox Game Pass, which recently surpassed 30 million subscribers.

During a sit-down interview on the official Xbox YouTube channel, Phil Spencer discussed the future of Activision Blizzard King following its recent acquisition by Microsoft which was finalized earlier this month. With the acquisition of such a large publisher, the possibilities are endless regarding what Microsoft and the Xbox brand could do to capitalize on them now owning some of gaming’s IPs. Still, Phil Spencer appears to be more conservative regarding making the most of what Microsoft now owns.

ABK’s Future On Xbox Game Pass

With such an expansive library at Microsoft’s fingertips now, the thought of Activision Blizzard King games making their way to Xbox Game Pass is very exciting, but Phil Spencer has confirmed that no ABK games will be appearing on Game Pass until 2024 saying,

“This acquisition is definitely long-term. So the fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping into Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future.”

This was expected as with the Bethesda acquisition it did take a while before many of its games made their way to Game Pass. It is also worth noting that hearing the word “2024” makes it seem like it will be a long time before we get to see franchises such as Call of Duty on Game Pass, but the new year is only a couple of months away so we should begin to see Activision Blizzard King’s library trickle onto the subscription services in the coming months.

Will Call Of Duty Receive Exclusive Content On Xbox?

Understandably, one of the biggest questions that has been asked throughout the acquisition is “What does this mean for the future of Call of Duty?” As we’ve seen with games such as Starfield bypassing Sony’s PlayStation after initially being announced, it is understandable that many saw the move as a way to drive players away from the PlayStation to the Xbox ecosystem in order to play the most popular first-person shooter franchise. Phil Spencer has confirmed that the goal is 100% parity when it comes to Call of Duty and making sure that whether you’re on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, or even Nintendo, no content is exclusive to a specific platform.

“We have no goal of somehow trying to use Call of Duty to get you to buy an Xbox console.”

Could We See Old IPs Come Back In The Future?

With such an expansive history of IPs, many gamers are wondering what the acquisition could mean in terms of bringing some beloved franchises back. Some notable IPs that have become moments in time include the likes of Spyro’s Skylanders spin-off series, Guitar Hero, Tony Hawk, and The Lost Vikings. It is possible that we could see some of these return in the future, but Phil Spencer stated that they would have to be done by passionate teams that want to make a difference rather than being motivated by financial gains.

“I want to make sure that when we’re going back and visiting something, that we do it with our complete ability– a motivated team that wants to go work on something and make a difference, not just create something for financial gain, or create something for a PR announcement and not deliver on the product.”

Tony Hawk’s 1+2 Remastered saw the first two games in the series return in 2020 to huge fanfare, which left many confused when a sequel was seemingly canceled. There have also been discussions on social media among gamers about the possibility of Guitar Hero returning. It would be interesting to see whether Activision Blizzard King could recapture the magic of the early games, but its main competitor Rock Band is still active with new weekly content for Rock Band 4, so there is at least some level of demand still there for a new game.

It will be an interesting time over the coming years to see how Microsoft capitalizes on the acquisition and whether it turns out to be a good thing for the company and for gamers alike.

Did Microsoft Waste $69 Billion on Activision Blizzard?
********
After nearly two years of regulatory proceedings, Microsoft (MSFT -1.40%) finally completed the acquisition of leading game producer Activision Blizzard. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority was the final holdout, but it granted approval of the deal in October.

The $68.7 billion acquisition is one of the largest in Microsoft's history. In exchange, the Xbox business gains an infusion of $8.7 billion in revenue from best-selling titles, including Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, in addition to some valuable mobile franchises, such as King's Candy Crush.

However, Microsoft didn't get everything it wanted. To get approval, it had to make some compromises. In July, Microsoft agreed to make one of the all-time best-selling franchises, Call of Duty, available to Sony and Nintendo's game consoles for 10 years.

It also agreed to let Ubisoft Entertainment buy Activision's cloud gaming rights. This means all the cloud gaming rights for Activision's PC and console content produced over the next 15 years will be owned by Ubisoft.

These compromises were needed to win the prize, but can Microsoft still reap enough growth out of Activision to justify the steep price tag?

Microsoft is building a large base of players

This won't be Microsoft's last acquisition of a video game company. Sony and Microsoft have been in an arms race to acquire studios in recent years to gain scale in the $200 billion video game industry. Microsoft previously paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda Softworks owner ZeniMax Media in 2020, so it's not surprising to see Microsoft swing for the fences with billions in cash resources.

Still, given the size of this transaction, shareholders will want to see good returns on this investment, especially after Microsoft just spent most of the $111 billion in cash and short-term investments it spent the last 30 years accumulating on its balance sheet.

Microsoft's gaming business just became one of the largest in the world. In fiscal 2023 (which ended in June), Microsoft's gaming revenue came to $15.5 billion, according to Statista estimates. Activision will add $8.7 billion to that total to bring Microsoft's gaming revenue to over $23 billion.

Activision will also contribute roughly $2.4 billion of free cash flow. But that means Microsoft paid a high price-to-free cash flow multiple of 28, which is expensive considering Activision's growth.

Over the last 10 years, Activision grew revenue by just 4.5% per year, with free cash flow growing 5.3% annually. Unless Microsoft can squeeze more growth out of this business, it might have overpaid.

When Microsoft originally announced the deal in January 2022, it spent as much time talking about the opportunity to expand into mobile gaming -- a $92 billion market -- as it did about cloud gaming opportunities. Although it doesn't have exclusive cloud gaming rights to Activision's future content, it should be able to grow Xbox Game Pass, which had 25 million subscribers in early 2022.

Game Pass has trailed Sony's 47 million subscribers in PS Plus, according to Statista. However, Microsoft now has a large pool of 356 million monthly active users to market new games and content to. This will satisfy one of Microsoft's top priorities, which is to build a community of players and increase the time players spend across a large portfolio of games. Those are the key ingredients that will create profitable growth opportunities in the video game industry.

Another overlooked opportunity for Microsoft is access to the intellectual property Activision has released going back to the 1980s. Microsoft will look to mine Activision's library for titles it can revive, and perhaps turn into valuable mobile properties. One that stands out is Guitar Hero, which Xbox head Phil Spencer has previously said he wants to revisit. Activision discontinued this franchise years ago, but the advantage of being part of Microsoft is that Activision can now take risks it couldn't before.

To answer the original question, no, I don't believe Microsoft wasted its cash. At least, it's too early to make that call. If Microsoft can help Activision release more new games at a faster pace and innovate with new ideas, the growth it could generate would go a long way toward justifying the cost of the acquisition. Depending on how much profit it can squeeze out of these franchises, this deal could look like a great value in a few years from now.

After blockbuster Microsoft deal, gaming giants are still sitting on $45 billion cash hoard
********

Publicly listed gaming companies are sitting on a $45 billion pile of cash and cash equivalents — and that could lead to greater consolidation in the $188 billion video games market, according to a new report from venture capital firm Konvoy, which was shared exclusively with CNBC. The likes of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts , Singapore's Sea , Japan's Nintendo and Bandai Namco , South Korea's Nexon , and China's NetEase , currently hold $45.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according Konvoy, which cited these companies' latest public reports.

Public gaming companies currently hold cash and cash equivalents of $45.1 billion, according to a report from venture capital firm Konvoy. Konvoy

That would give them more than enough financial firepower to look at potential acquisition targets that could help them build out their intellectual property and products. In particular, gaming firms are looking to keep gamers more engaged for longer with live-service games that add more content over time and paid subscription packages that offer a certain amount of free games and access to cloud gaming, or the ability to play games via the cloud rather than downloading them to their machines. Publicly listed gaming companies had a fairly rosy year in 2023, on the whole. The VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF , which seeks to track MVIS Global Video Gaming & eSports Index, has climbed 20% in the year to date, according to Konvoy. The blue-chip S&P 500 index, by contrast, has climbed close to 12% year to date.

The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF , which aims to track a modified market-cap-weighted global index of companies in video games and esports, hasn't performed as well, slipping 0.4% since the start of 2023.

Big Tech eyes video games

Big Tech firms are also primed with plenty of cash to consider more gaming deals, according to Konvoy. The VC firm said that the world's biggest tech firms which includes Amazon , Microsoft , Google, Apple , Meta , Netflix , China's Tencent , and Japan's Sony , have a combined $229.4 billion of cash on their balance sheets to deploy on potential deals.

Josh Chapman, a partner at Konvoy, said the company expects the Microsoft-Activision deal — which saw the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant pay $69 billion for U.S. game publisher Activision Blizzard — would likely lead to further mergers and acquisition activity and create a new generation of gaming companies. "As active gaming investors, we believe that gamers and gaming startups stand to benefit from the deal as it improves the value-proposition for gamers and leads to a vibrant M&A environment for other deals to get closed," Chapman told CNBC in emailed comments. Cloud gaming is a key area for Microsoft as it brings Activision into its growing portfolio of game publishers. The company is pushing its cloud gaming service, which does away with the need for traditional consoles likes its Xbox Series X or Sony's PlayStation 5, with its Xbox Game Pass subscription product. Chapman said this would lead to "new opportunities for emerging game developers, infrastructure companies and gaming platforms." Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of Activision Blizzard was approved by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority earlier this month. The deal, valued at $69 billion, will see Microsoft gain ownership of some of the most lucrative properties in video games, including the massive Call of Duty franchise, Candy Crush, Crash Bandicoot, Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch.

VC deal slump

Venture capital investment into video game firms slumped 64% year over year in the third quarter of 2023, according to Konvoy's report.

Total venture funding into the video games industry in the third quarter of 2023 fell 9% quarter-over-quarter, to $454 million. Konvoy

It's a sign of how, despite the boost to the industry from Microsoft's landmark deal, the boom times for the industry in 2020 and 2021 have ebbed. Gaming startups raised a combined $454 million globally for the three months to September, down 9% quarter over quarter and more than 64% from the same three-month period a year ago.

Still, Konvoy's Chapman anticipates the picture for gaming VCs and startups will look brighter next year, as grim venture investing conditions start to improve — however, funding for gaming firms has returned to a " sustainable new normal" that will continue at the current pace for the next few years. "As the global venture market rebounds we expect gaming, which was somewhat insulated from the initial impact of the economic downturn, to follow," Chapman told CNBC. "We anticipate gaming VC funding to see a slight uptick over the next few quarters, when the industry will grow at a similar rate to before the pandemic." "Right now, VC deal volume and funding are comparable to pre-pandemic levels, and while we may not see the exponential growth of 2021, we're excited to see a stable venture funding market in gaming for continued value creation in the industry."

Tougher times

Video game publishers have been grappling with a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, with high inflation and rising interest rates denting consumer appetite for discretionary spending. Whereas in 2020, when consumers were flush with cash thanks to easy monetary conditions, times have gotten tougher in 2022 and 2023 as central bankers have increased interest rates in a bid to stem rising prices. Still, the video game player base continues to increase, with a worldwide player base of 3.381 million today, according to Konvoy. The video game market is still massive, and is projected to reach $188 billion in overall sales in 2023, according to Konvoy. That figure is up a modest 3% from the previous year, when gaming sales totaled $183 billion. But growth has accelerated slightly from 2022, when gaming sales rose only 2%. That came after the standout year of 2021. Gaming revenue reached $180 billion that year, climbing more than 8% from $166 billion in 2020 I assume, according to Konvoy's research. In 2020, the industry saw even bigger growth — more than 9% year over year. That was when pandemic lockdowns were in full swing, and people had more time to spend playing video games indoors. Konvoy is projecting long-term growth for the games industry in the coming years, though. The firm said that it expects a compound annual growth rate of 9% in the next five years, with the industry reaching a whopping $288 billion in overall sales by 2028.

Xbox CEO explains why Activision Blizzard Games aren't on Game Pass yet
********
Update October 18, 2023 at 8 AM ET: Xbox's Phil Spencer clarified in an interview that Microsoft isn't expecting to begin ABK game integrations until 2024 for Xbox Game Pass.

After 19 months of court cases, talks with regulators, and legal battles, Microsoft finally purchased Activision Blizzard. The deal, worth $69 billion, has been the talk of the tech world and the gaming industry since the acquisition was first announced in January 2022. Now that it's done, the discussion shifts to how soon the library of games from Activision Blizzard will make its way to Game Pass.

Statements from Activision Blizzard and precedent set by Microsoft's past gaming acquisitions give us some idea of when ABK titles will be added to Game Pass, but we still don't know a lot. Even comments from Phil Spencer, CEO Microsoft Gaming, only shed a bit of light on the company's plans.

How Activision Blizzard compares to Microsoft buying Bethesda

(Image credit: Bethesda Softworks LLC)

Activision Blizzard is the largest acquisition Microsoft has ever made, but it's far from the only purchase. Microsoft bought Bethesda in March 2021. Less than one week after that deal, 20 Bethesda titles were added to the Xbox Game Pass list. More games made their way to Microsoft's subscription service, including the complete mainline Fallout series in June 2022. Several classic Bethesda titles followed in August, including Quake 4.

With Bethesda entirely in the fold, Starfield launched earlier this year. It earned high praise and was called "one of Microsoft's best exclusive games in over a decade" in our Starfield review.

Microsoft will likely take a similar approach to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Some titles will go to Game Pass sooner rather than later, while more will be added over time. Of course, some games may take much longer than others.

How Activision Blizzard is different than past acquisitions

(Image credit: Activision Publishing)

Don't book off work yet, as you likely won't be able to get the biggest Activision Blizzard titles through Xbox Game Pass right away. In fact, you'll have to wait until at least 2024. Even then, titles will likely roll out gradually.

With the largest acquisition in Microsoft's history comes many complicated steps the tech giant will have to take. Call of Duty is one of the largest gaming franchises, so it is expectedly connected to several licensing deals. Before the CMA approved Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, the latter discussed its plans for Call of Duty.

The gaming giant said it doesn't have immediate plans to offer Modern Warfare III or Diablo IV. Instead, Microsoft will likely look into adding premium games to Game Pass some time in 2024.

It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass. While we do not have plans to put Modern Warfare® III or Diablo IV into Game Pass this year, once the deal closes, we expect to start working with Xbox to bring our titles to more players around the world. And we anticipate that we would begin adding games into Game Pass sometime in the course of next year. @ATVI_AB on X (Twitter)

Activision Blizzard was vague even when stating that premium ABK games will likely come to Game Pass in 2024. There are likely a lot of agreements in place and discussions to be had before you see the entire ABK library on Game Pass.

Making sure Activision Blizzard doesn't hurt Game Pass

As strange as it may sound, Microsoft has to ensure that adding Activision Blizzard games to its subscription service does not hurt Game Pass. Microsoft has deals with third-party developers that would likely be unhappy if a sudden drop of Call of Duty or another popular ABK title undercut their own title on Xbox Game Pass.

Xbox Game Pass titles also get engagement bonuses, so Microsoft has to juggle things in that regard. If a sudden wave of Activision Blizzard titles dropped the engagement of games that are part of a deal with a third-party, that could affect that company's relationship with Microsoft and Xbox.

There's a good chance that Microsoft will stagger the release of ABK games. Curating titles rather than dropping them all at once would allow the tech giant to direct people toward specific games and help ensure a smooth integration of Activision Blizzard into Xbox Game Pass and other forms of Game Pass.

Why aren't Activision Blizzard games on Game Pass?

(Image credit: Official Xbox Podcast)

Spencer's comments echoed the sentiments of Activision Blizzards. The gaming executive also shared why Activision Blizzard games haven't been added to Game Pass yet.

"The regulatory process took so long, and frankly there was a lot of uncertainty in that process... that we weren’t able to get in and work with [Activision Blizzard] on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, we’re starting that work, but there is work," said Spencer during an episode of the Xbox podcast.

"I think the Activision Twitter handle... did put out something that talked about 2024. I think that’s accurate. I would love it if there was some kind of secret celebration drop that’s coming in the next couple of weeks — there’s not."

Spencer emphasized that if Microsoft had plans to add ABK games to Game Pass this year that he'd "be straight with people" and announce what was on the way.

During that same podcast episode, Spencer said that while he doesn't plan to force studios to revive old IP, that he would be "all in" if a team wanted to bring back a franchise.

A massive opportunity for Xbox and Activision Blizzard

Microsoft Launches $3.65 Billion Exchange for Activision Debt
********
(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has kicked off an exchange offer for Activision Blizzard Inc.’s outstanding debt as part of its acquisition of the game and entertainment software company.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The world’s largest software maker will replace the Activision securities currently held by bondholders with up to $3.65 billion of new notes and a cash consideration, according to a statement.

As part of the exchange offer, Activision will be soliciting consents from eligible bondholders “to adopt certain proposed amendments” to the existing bond that will get rid of certain covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default, according to the release.

The early tender date for the offer is October 27, at which time bondholders would be eligible to receive the total exchange consideration. The last day for bondholders to submit tender offers is November 14. Both dates are able to be extended by the company.

On Monday, Microsoft completed its $69 billion purchase of Activision after a nearly two-year fight with global regulators threatened to scuttle the deal. The transaction was able to close after Microsoft made alterations to its merger agreement to win over UK authorities.

The US Federal Trade Commission, which lost an attempt to block the deal in court, continues to pursue legal action in its own administrative hearing. That could still force the two companies to unwind the merger if the commission is successful.

Microsoft-Activision is a done deal – but what if the FTC still wins? Ask Whole Foods.

Oct 19 (Reuters) - Champagne corks may have been popping in Redmond, Washington, last week after Microsoft (MSFT.O) closed its $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.MX), but the tech giant’s fight with U.S. antitrust regulators isn’t over yet.

Although the Federal Trade Commission to date has lost every attempt to halt the merger, the antitrust enforcer isn’t stepping down. Agency lawyers are set to appear before a federal appeals court in December to argue the deal is anticompetitive, while also prepping for an in-house administrative trial further down the road.

Back in the day, I wrote about antitrust litigation as a reporter, and the Microsoft-Activision tie-up got me thinking about another hotly contested deal I covered.

In 2008, the FTC scored a narrow appellate win in challenging Whole Foods’ $565 million acquisition of rival grocer Wild Oats -- a decision that came nearly a year after the two supermarket chains had consummated their merger, and one that forced Whole Foods into a costly settlement.

Could something similar happen to Microsoft and Activision?

Probably not, said now-retired Dechert partner Paul Denis, who was Whole Foods' lead lawyer.

To be sure, the FTC litigates just a handful of merger cases each year, and each one plays out differently.

For example, the agency is currently deep in litigation against Illumina over the company's already-consummated acquisition of cancer detection test maker Grail.

The Whole Foods case also had unique appellate quirks that are unlikely to be duplicated -- but procedurally, the Microsoft case has been unfolding in a strikingly similar way.

The Microsoft challenge “feels very familiar,” Denis told me. “The FTC is clearly trying to plow some new ground -- as they attempted with Whole Foods and now with Microsoft” in pursuing aggressive theories of antitrust enforcement.

Microsoft, which already made significant concessions to win approval from competition regulators in Britain and Europe, says the Activision merger will benefit consumers and the video game industry by bringing “more games to more people.”

A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment directly on the litigation, but President Brad Smith in a blog post noted the company has garnered friend-of-the-court support from antitrust scholars, economists and former government officials, as well as business and labor groups – “an almost unprecedented range of diverse parties,” Smith wrote.

The agency is undeterred. “The FTC continues to believe this deal is a threat to competition,” spokesperson Victoria Graham said via email. “We remain focused on the federal appeal process despite Microsoft and Activision closing their deal.”

The FTC asserts that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, which makes the wildly popular “Call of Duty” series, would enable the combined company “to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription and cloud-gaming business.”

As it did with Whole Foods 16 years ago, the FTC filed what’s known as a Part 3 administrative complaint to block the merger, arguing the tie-up would stifle competition and harm consumers.

Agency lawyers in both cases also sued the companies in federal court, seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the deals from being consummated pending resolution of the slower-moving administrative action.

And in both cases, the FTC was soundly defeated in district court.

As San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in siding with Microsoft wrote in a 53-page opinion in July, the FTC “has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim” that the merger may substantially lessen competition. If anything, she found, the “evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.”

In the Whole Foods case, the FTC unsuccessfully argued that the grocer, which at the time had 194 stores, would gain a near-monopoly in the “premium, natural and organic supermarket” category by acquiring 110 stores from Wild Oats.

Whole Foods, which was subsequently bought by Amazon in 2017, did not respond to a request for comment.

The FTC in each instance appealed its losses, but failed to win emergency injunctions from higher courts that would freeze the mergers while litigation was pending.

Both Microsoft and Whole Foods then went on to close their deals, apparently gambling the FTC was a paper tiger and they’d live happily ever after in post-merger bliss.

For Whole Foods, it didn’t quite work out that way.

The original trio of D.C. Circuit judges that rebuked the FTC’s bid for an emergency stay had changed, with Judge Janice Rogers Brown replacing Judge David Sentelle.

The substitution proved fateful, Denis said. In a surprise move, the court in a 2-1 decision remanded the case for further consideration, with Brown writing that the lower court judge didn’t focus enough on how the merger might affect Whole Foods’ “core” customers.

At that point, it made little business sense for Whole Foods to keep fighting, not with the threat of drawn-out a Part 3 trial hanging over its head – a process which by statute is only available to the FTC, not the Justice Department. The two agencies share responsibility for antitrust enforcement, but DOJ is confined to litigating in federal court -- but that’s another column.

“Whole Foods ended up having to settle,” Denis said, agreeing in 2009 to divest 32 stores and the Wild Oats brand name.

It was a possibility the company had “war-gamed out” ahead of time, he said. As a horizontal merger between direct competitors, such divestitures are the usual fix to mollify regulators.

The Microsoft-Activision case is a vertical merger, however, where the companies operate in the same industry but provide different services. That can make it harder to predict what concessions would satisfy regulators, Denis said.

Microsoft is represented by Wilkinson Stekloff; Weil Gotshal & Manges; and Sidley Austin, with Activision turning to Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom.

As my Reuters colleagues reported, Microsoft agreed to sell the non-European streaming rights to Activision’s games to Ubisoft Entertainment to assuage concerns by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, which approved the merger on Oct. 13.

The FTC said it’s still weighing these concessions.

The new Ubisoft agreement, agency spokesperson Graham said, “presents a whole new facet to the merger that will affect American consumers, which the FTC will assess as part of its ongoing administrative proceeding.”

Prices for Activision games in Argentina and Turkey soar by 2,300% and nearly 1,000% respectively
********
Just a few days after Microsoft completed its record-breaking acquisition of Activision Blizzard, regional prices for the company’s games on Steam have skyrocketed in Argentina and Turkey. The changes affected the Call of Duty franchise, as well as some classic titles.

Based on SteamDB data, Activision updated prices for its games in several regions on October 16. Argentina and Turkey were the two countries affected the most by the changes.

Below are the new prices for Call of Duty and other Activision titles in Argentine pesos and Turkish lira, and how they have changed compared to previous ones:

Recent price increase for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in Argentina (via SteamDB)

Interestingly, some titles have now become more expensive in Argentina compared to the US dollar. For example, converting Call of Duty: Black Ops II’s new regional price of ARS 24,000 results in $68.56 (vs. the US price of $59.99), Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy now costs $45.71 (vs. the US price of $39.99), etc.

As reported by The Gamer, prices for Activision games also increased in Brazil — e.g. Call of Duty: Black Ops II went up nearly 150%. Upon further examination of SteamDB, it turned out that the changes affected regions such as Kazakhstan, South Korea, Ukraine, Indonesia, Philippines, and Uruguay. But the hikes were not as dramatic compared to Argentina and Turkey.

It is unclear whether this has anything to do with the closing of Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, as the Call of Duty maker could have planned the increase ahead. But this move is in line with the ongoing trend of big publishers phasing out cheap regional prices due to fluctuations in some currencies against the US dollar. This is also part of the fight against players switching their Steam regions to buy cheaper games in Latin America, Turkey, or Kazakhstan.

Last year, Valve updated recommended regional prices, with Turkey and Argetina seeing hikes of more than 450%. This led to many publishers increasing the prices for their products, especially in regions where they were historically cheap.

Video games, however, are not the only thing getting more expensive for customers in certain countries. For example, Sony last month increased PS Plus prices in Turkey by nearly 500%, while prices in the US, UK, and Japan went up 20-30%.

2 Green Flags for Microsoft's Future
********
Microsoft (MSFT -1.40%) has been a company to watch this year after becoming one of the biggest names in artificial intelligence (AI) and completing its purchase of game developer Activision Blizzard. The tech giant is on a promising growth trajectory as it expands in multiple areas of tech and could have a lot to offer investors over the long term.

Only a decade ago, Microsoft appeared to be fading from relevancy, losing ground to the likes of Apple and Alphabet. However, current CEO Satya Nadella has pulled off an impressive turnaround since taking on the position in 2014. The company has rebuilt itself and could prove unstoppable in the coming years.

So, here are two green flags for Microsoft's future.

1. Arguably the most influential company in artificial intelligence

In 2023, Microsoft has emerged as a major player in AI. The company's over $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI has granted it a 49% stake in the start-up. The partnership gave Microsoft a head start in the industry, coming out ahead of cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet.

Microsoft has hastily integrated OpenAI's technology across its software lineup, including updates to its cloud platform Azure, Office productivity suite, Bing, and more. OpenAI CEO Sam Alterman told The Information last week that the company is generating revenue at a pace of more than $1 billion a year. OpenAI's revenue in 2022 totalted $28 million. However, the start-up's AI technology and the potency of Microsoft's productivity brands could prove a killer combination.

Alongside attracting customers to its AI services on Azure, Microsoft is monetizing its AI expansion by adding new tools to other platforms.

The company will soon launch Copilot, an AI assistant for Microsoft 365 users that will debut as a $30 add-on to a regular 365 subscription. Copilot could be the start of a lucrative future for the company as it expands its AI offerings.

Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market was valued at $137 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. Meanwhile, with its cloud services and various productivity platforms, Microsoft is well positioned to become the go-to for the millions of businesses and consumers looking to add AI to their daily workflows.

The popularity of Microsoft's products has made it one of the most influential companies in AI, and you won't want to miss out on its future in the sector.

2. Completing the biggest video game deal in history

In January 2022, Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard in a deal worth a record $69 billion. The purchase has been held up by antitrust concerns, with regulators worldwide performing checks on whether it would grant Microsoft too much control of the market. However, the deal officially went through last week when U.K. regulators gave their approval after some revisions to the acquisition.

Activision Blizzard is home to some of the world's most profitable game franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Candy Crush, and more. The valuable library of titles will be an asset in expanding Microsoft's Xbox brand and Game Pass service.

Game Pass is a subscription-based platform, often described as a Netflix for games, which has proven useful in attracting new users to the company's consoles and services. Xbox Game Pass has rapidly grown since its launch in 2017, with subscribers increasing by 150% between 2020 and 2022.

When purchasing a console, consumers have long faced the question of whether to buy Sony's PlayStation or an Xbox. However, Xbox Game Pass has strengthened the argument for Microsoft's console, increasing the value of an Xbox as users can pay a monthly fee for access to a large library of games rather than paying for titles individually. Introducing Activision's games to Game Pass will only make Xbox consoles and services more attractive to shoppers.

Microsoft's annual revenue has risen 68% over the last five years, with operating income up 106%. However, there's no telling how far those figures could climb over the next five years as it continues to expand in AI and video games. Microsoft has massive potential over the long term, making its stock a screaming buy right now.

40 studios to rule them all: inside Microsoft Gaming divisions post-Activision Blizzard deal
********
Now that Activision Blizzard has joined Microsoft, it has one of the most impressive portfolios of game studios in the industry. Let’s take a closer look at all of its development and publishing subsidiaries, as well as their key IPs.

Since Phil Spencer took over Xbox, Microsoft’s gaming business has expanded significantly, largely thanks to the multi-billion acquisitons of ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard (as well as a number of smaller M&A deals).

The company now owns roughly 40 subsidiaries, including game development studios, publishers, and support teams. All of them are part of the larger Microsoft Gaming organization, which is led by Spencer as CEO.

Below are Microsoft’s main first-party studios broken down into three divisions: Xbox Game Studios, ZeniMax Media, and Activision Blizzard. But keep in mind that the company is likely to make some changes to its structure after completing its latest $68.7 billion deal, which could lead to some internal mergers and even layoffs or the divestment of certain smaller assets.

Xbox Game Studios

Turn 10 Studios (established by Microsoft)

Founded : 2002

: 2002 IP : Forza Motorsport

: Forza Motorsport Games released: 9

Founded in 2001, Turn 10 is still led by its co-founder Dan Greenawalt, who also serves as general manager of the Forza Motorsport franchise. He oversaw the production of all titles in the series, including the Forza Horizon IP (developed by Playground Games).

Bonnie Ross started 343 Industries in 2007, shortly after Bungie announced its split from Microsoft, to manage the further development of the Halo franchise. Since then, the studio has helped ship 11 games, including Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite.

The latter became a live service title, and 343 is now putting all its efforts into content support of the game by releasing new seasons, game modes, and (recently) the Forge AI Toolkit. However, a number of key developers have left the team since October 2020, including Bonnie Ross, art director Nicolas Bouvier, and technical director David Berger.

In 2014, Microsoft acquired the Gears of War IP from Epic Games and put Black Tusk (this time renamed to The Coalition) in charge of the series. Since then, the studio has released Gears of War 4 and Gears 5, as well as contributed to Gears Tactics and The Matrix Awakens demo.

However, the game unfortunately got stuck in a sort of development hell. During 2021, dozens of developers left The Initiative, including core writers, designers, and game director Dan Neuburger (was in charge of several Tomb Raider games).

The studio even partnered with Crystal Dynamisc to finish Perfect Dark, but its current state is still unclear. In August 2023, IGN reported that the game is still “roughly two to three years away from being ready for release.”

Right now, the team is also helping TiMi Studio Group, a subsidiary of Tencent and developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, with Age of Empires Mobile. It is yet to be launched globally, but its Chinese version, Return to Empire, broke into the top 10 highest-grossing iOS games in the country upon its release in March 2021.

Microsoft Stock Earnings Preview: Can MSFT Beat Estimates?
********
Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row. Will it be five?

Microsoft will report quarterly earnings on October 24 after the stock market closes at 3:05 p.m. Central Time.

The tech giant is expected to post EPS of $2.65 on $54.54 billion in revenue.

Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row.

The Activision-Blizzard acquisition has finally closed, securing Microsoft's big gaming and VR investment.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock has had a great 2023 so far, opening the year at $243.08 and sitting well above that mark at a current price of $327.

The stock is already up 35% on the year, and we've yet to approach the holiday season where new bonus money tends to hit the stock market—we'll see if the recent market selloff will scare investors away or entice them to invest in big-name tech stocks like Microsoft.

The stock price has a +-$14.68 expected move through next week based on current implied volatility, which encompasses the upcoming earnings announcement. The stock has a +-$28.04 expected move through the December monthly options cycle, which means this earnings week accounts for about half of the expected movement through nearly the rest of the year.

Microsoft finally closed its $69 billion gaming deal with Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) which is the biggest gaming deal we've seen yet. It also bolstered its artificial intelligence efforts, which sets the company up for a nice positive narrative on this quarterly earnings call.

Microsoft beat earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates four quarters in a row, and revenue estimates 75% of the time during the same period. I don't see much of a negative sentiment with Microsoft earnings this time around with so much positive news, but we'll see what the market says on Tuesday.

Bearish on Microsoft Earnings

Observers have lofty expectations of a strong forecast during Microsoft's earnings call this quarter, and this shouldn't surprise anyone after the massive acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. With grand expectations come an easier path to disappointment though. If future guidance is weak and the tech giant fails to beat EPS and/or revenue expectations—or any other negative surprise becomes known—we could see this popular tech stock fall in value after the earnings announcement in this bleak stock market we've seen recently.

Spyro 4 finally on the horizon, but may now be Xbox exclusive
********
The Spyro series is one of the most popular OG PlayStation games in history alongside its fellow platforming icon, Crash Bandicoot.

Advert 10

From 1998 to 2000, the Spyro series was published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, which was later passed around by companies before Activision acquired the licence in 2008. Spyro would become a successful franchise on multiple platforms including PC, Nintendo, and Xbox as well as on the PlayStation brand.

Check out the Spyro Reignited Trilogy trailer below!

Advert 10

The most recent release in the series was Spyro Reignited Trilogy in 2018 on PS4 and Xbox One before making its way to PC and Nintendo Switch. This collection of glorious classics included remasters of the original three games that were released on PS1. There were rumours of a Spyro 4 circulating earlier this month, but as of yet, nothing has materialised.

Earlier this week the biggest saga in recent video game history came to an end after Microsoft finally acquired Activision Blizzard in a deal worth $68.7 billion. As a result of this goliath takeover, it means that franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Crash Bandicoot and of course, Spyro became first-party Xbox properties.

We already know that Call of Duty will remain multiplatform following the takeover, at least for the foreseeable future, but what about the other Activision properties? Well, it seems that some may become Xbox console exclusives, which should come as no surprise.

Advert 10

Fans on Reddit have been discussing the future of the Spyro series with it potentially becoming an Xbox exclusive. “Spyro joins Xbox! Hopefully, this could push for having a new Spyro game in the future,” said Redditor LuxerWap kicking off the discussion on the thread.

“Potentially great for Spyro maybe but not good for the industry as a whole and definitely not good for gamers :( I'm sad this acquisition got approved,” replied gamblingGenocider.

“I'm not happy about this, I have no interest in owning an Xbox and I don't enjoy gaming on PC compared to my Switch or PS5,” exclaimed sunyoung-luna. “Yay, a new game..... oh wait! I won't get to play it because it'll be exclusive to Xbox!! No way I'm buying a brand new console for two IPs (Crash and Spyro),” said a downbeat Alternative-Pay6464.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says he weighs 2 factors when considering making an acquisition
********
Microsoft has made several big acquisitions in the past decade under CEO Satya Nadella. Axel Springer

Satya Nadella has orchestrated a slew of acquisitions at Microsoft since becoming CEO in 2014.

He laid out his criteria for possible acquisitions at Axel Springer's annual award ceremony Tuesday.

His remarks come on the heels of Microsoft closing its $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal.

Satya Nadella has closed a number of deals for Microsoft in his tenure as CEO, and he says there are two key factors he considers when eyeing possible acquisitions.

Nadella discussed his thought process for acquisitions while speaking at the Axel Springer Award ceremony in Berlin on Tuesday. Axel Springer is Insider's parent company.

"To me there are a couple of criteria," Nadella said. "First thing is, is this something that Microsoft can add real value to? If you take LinkedIn or GitHub or Activision or Mojang or what have you, they all have to make sense that Microsoft has some unique contribution that we can make both because of our technology, our brand, our go-to-market to the asset. Otherwise, why do it? And then of course at the end of the day, it has to make financial sense as well."

After clearing hurdles with antitrust regulators, Microsoft has closed its $69 billion deal with Activision Blizzard, the video games publisher behind blockbusters like "Call of Duty" and "World of Warcraft." Microsoft also bought Minecraft creator Mojang Studios for $2.5 billion in November 2014.

Nadella has spoken before about the importance of gaming to Microsoft's future.

"As a large company, I think it's critical to define the core, but it's important to make smart choices on other businesses in which we can have fundamental impact and success," he wrote in a memo to employees a few months after he became CEO in 2014. "The single biggest digital life category, measured in both time and money spent, in a mobile-first world is gaming."

With Nadella at the helm, Microsoft also bought professional networking site LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016 and code hosting platform GitHub for $7.5 billion in 2018. Microsoft has also invested $13 billion into OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella promotes the company's AI push in its annual report for 2023
********
Microsoft has just released its annual financial report for its 2023 fiscal year As part of that report, its CEO Satya Nadella has written and published his annual letter to the company's shareholders. As expected, Nadella is continuing to push Microsoft's big bet with generative AI, which he feels "will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual, organization, and industry on earth."

In his letter, Nadella stated:

This next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight years after its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again—from PC/Server, to Web/Internet, to Cloud/Mobile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once again, as we lead this new era.

In his lengthy letter, Nadella offers some examples of how Microsoft's AI products are already helping companies around the world. He cites the Latin American online marketplace company Mercado Libre which is using GitHub Copilot to help reduce the time its developers take to write code. He also mentions how the car maker Mercedes-Benz is testing the use of ChatGPT, powered by Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, so its in-car assistant is improved.

Nadella says that the combination of natural language and a "new reasoning engine" have helped to launch this new AI era at Microsoft. He added:

Together, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our vision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.

The letter goes over the new products and services that Microsoft has introduced over the past year in its various departments. Of course, he also mentions, almost in passing, the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft for nearly $69 billion, which is by far the biggest purchase in the company's history.

One big thing Nadella failed to mention in his annual report is Microsoft's decision to lay off 10,000 of its employees in January 2023. Those layoffs are continuing at the company, as its LinkedIn subsidiary recently announced it would let go of 668 additional workers.

Organizing Update
********
Microsoft/Activision Blizzard

Last Friday, Microsoft completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, paving the way for the implementation of CWA’s groundbreaking labor neutrality agreement for workers at the company. Thousands of video game workers will now have a free and fair process for joining CWA.

“It is a new day for workers at Activision Blizzard,” said CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. “Over two years ago, workers at Activision Blizzard’s studios captured the country’s attention through walkouts and other protests over discrimination, sexual harassment, pay inequity, and other issues they were facing on the job. Their efforts to form unions were met with illegal retaliation and attempts to delay and block union elections. Now these workers are free to join our union through a fair process, without interference from management. Microsoft’s high-road approach should be the norm across the industry.”
********
Microsoft is now a gaming juggernaut
********
Microsoft (MSFT) officially owns Activision Blizzard (ATVI), making it the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue behind just Tencent and Sony (SONY). But the acquisition does more than boost Microsoft’s standing in the global gaming industry. It gives the company far greater access to the mobile gaming market, lines it up for revenue via mobile games advertising, and provides it with the opportunity to grow its Xbox Game Pass subscription service and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming service.

“It's certainly a seismic shift in how the money flows around the gaming ecosystem,” explained International Data Corporation (IDC) research director Lewis Ward. “It is the biggest acquisition in Microsoft's history. It is one of the biggest acquisitions in the tech market. It is … by anyone’s measure, a big sea change.”

But don’t expect the company to start reaping the benefits of the $69-billion deal anytime soon. Microsoft still has a long way to go before it can begin to put its stamp on any of Activision Blizzard’s games like “Call of Duty” and longer still before its bet on cloud gaming pays off.

Microsoft is a major mobile player

Microsoft has never had much of a hand in the mobile gaming market. And while the console and PC markets are huge, bringing in $43 billion and $40 billion respectively in 2023, the mobile gaming market is even larger. According to a study by data.ai and IDC, the segment will bring in a whopping $103 billion this year alone.

But with Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now one of the biggest players in mobile gaming. Activision Blizzard’s “Candy Crush Saga” was the second-highest-grossing mobile game in the world in the first half of 2023 behind only Tencent’s “Honor of Kings.” And as of Q2 2023, Activision Blizzard’s King mobile division had an incredible 238 million monthly active users. That’s far more than Activision’s 92 million, despite that arm running “Call of Duty,” or Blizzard’s 26 million.

“The amount of revenue that 'Candy Crush' generates should not be underestimated,” said Forrester senior analyst Will McKeon-White. “Microsoft has also traditionally had a minimal ... mobile gaming presence. So this acquisition also significantly helps out with that.”

That mobile presence also gives Microsoft a significant leg up in the mobile advertising space. After all, mobile games generate money via either in-game sales or ads, and “Candy Crush” does both.

Subscriptions and cloud gaming are key

Outside of mobile gaming, Activision Blizzard gives Microsoft the firepower it needs to exploit its Game Pass subscription service and nascent Xbox Cloud Gaming. Game Pass gives subscribers access to hundreds of games that they can download to their Xbox consoles or PCs for $16.99 per month. The service has been a key portion of Microsoft’s gaming strategy, with CEO Satya Nadella regularly calling out the service during the company’s earnings calls.

In January, Nadella announced that the service had surpassed 120 million monthly active users. And with Activision Blizzard’s library of intellectual property, Microsoft can make Game Pass an even more appealing option for gamers, giving the company more firepower to drive subscriptions over time.

Then there’s the cloud gaming aspect of the deal. Microsoft is the leader in cloud gaming, and has opened up the service to a slew of new devices including smart TVs and even Meta’s (META) Quest 3 AR/VR headset. But cloud gaming is still in its early stages. The quality of streams doesn’t always match up to what you’d get playing games on a console or PC, and high-speed internet still isn’t available in portions of the US, let alone globally.

“In terms of cloud gaming, we're still in the active experimentation phase,” McKeon-White said. “And while the current results are much better than they were previously, it's still ... not the best possible experience for playing video games, if we’re completely honest.”

It’s also important to note that cloud gaming is still a small portion of overall gaming revenue. But, eventually, the service could power Game Pass subscriptions.

“I think it is a positive for cloudstream gaming,” Ward said. “I think that it will be one of the drivers of growth over time, but let's not kid ourselves. Right now, it's only like 2% or 3% of market revenue. It's a very small component of total market revenue.”

But as Microsoft perfects the technology and high-speed internet continues to spread across the globe, Xbox Cloud Gaming will become a far more attractive and viable option for gamers in regions where consoles and PCs are too expensive due to taxes or import restrictions.

Microsoft can take advantage of Activision Blizzard’s library

There’s one other aspect to Microsoft’s acquisition that could prove beneficial over time, and that’s how the company could take advantage of older Activision Blizzard properties. There are a slew of titles, such as “Guitar Hero,” that the gaming giant hasn’t worked on in years, and with Microsoft’s backing, it could begin to dig those out of storage and breathe new life into them.

What’s more, it gives Microsoft a boost to the number of first-party games it will release each year.

“There's just a critical mass that they probably weren't at prior to the acquisition, and this pushes them over the top,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance. “You suddenly go from maybe a half a game a year of new content under the old Microsoft to four, five, plus ‘World of Warcraft.’ ”

Taken as a whole, the acquisition is a boon for Microsoft. Though it could take some time for it to begin to pay dividends. After all, with games already in development it will be a while before Microsoft has any real say in how Activision Blizzard develops new titles.

There’s also the looming threat that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could break up the companies as part of its antitrust case against Microsoft. The FTC is moving forward with an in-house challenge to the deal and working on an appeal to a prior ruling against the commission’s effort to halt the move.

Still, if everything pans out in Microsoft’s favor, acquiring Activision Blizzard could be a turning point for the company, and the gaming industry as a whole.

Diablo 4 Season 2 is set to bring with it the 'Season of Blood' as the game welcomes vampires alongside its launch on Steam. Just in time for Halloween, the vampire-themed content is perfect for a spooky October.

The Mirror reports the second of Diablo 4's quarterly updates kicks off this week, with the Diablo 4 Season 2 patch notes being revealed earlier this month. Unlike the 'disastrous' launch of Diablo 4 Season 1 which caused fan backlash, Diablo 4 Season 2 should hopefully bring the game back to its former glory.

Diablo 4 Season 2 also marks the release of the game on Steam. Until recently, Blizzard titles have been exclusive to its own Battle.net service, with Overwatch 2 launching on Valve's platform back in August and subsequently became one of the worst-rated games on Steam with 90 per cent of user reviews being negative on the Overwatch 2 Steam page.

Diablo 4 Season 2 start time

Blizzard confirmed via a post on the Blizzard website that Diablo 4 Season 2 will begin on Tuesday, October 17 at 6pm BST. Unlike Diablo 4 Season 1 where Diablo 4 patch 1.1.0a launched a couple of days before Season 1 kicked off, Blizzard has confirmed that Diablo 4 patch 1.2.0 will go live on October 17 alongside the launch of the new season.

Diablo 4 Season 2 will launch mere days after Microsoft completed its $69 billion acquisition of Diablo developer Activision Blizzard.

What's new in Diablo 4 Season 2

Diablo Season 2 will introduce a vampire-themed story and new gear will be available to go alongside it. The Season of Blood isn't a full expansion, that comes next year, but will still see plenty of new content added. Polygon reports:

Vampire hunter Erys anchors a seasonal quest line that sees you fight against a vampire lord.

You can wield vampiric powers and equip gear called Pact Armor.

The Seasonal Realm will once again feature both a free and paid version of the battle pass.

Seasonal Realm Season 2 will feature the Blood Harvest Seasonal Event, which tasks you with fighting waves of vampires in specific areas of Sanctuary.

There will be five new endgame bosses, each of whom has a different resistance type.

All five classes are getting slightly tweaked.

Diablo 4 Steam release time

For the first time, Diablo 4 will be available on Steam, after being a Battle.net exclusive for four months. The Diablo 4 Steam release is set for Tuesday, October 17 at 6pm - the exact same time as Diablo 4 Season 2 launches.

Unfortunately, because the game isn't available to pre-order on Steam, there is no preload available to players. You'll need to wait until Diablo 4 launches on Steam to buy it and download the 90GB file before you can jump into Diablo 4 Season 2 (although we'd imagine you would want to play the base game first).

Bobby Kotick Confirms he will be CEO of Activision Blizzard until the end of 2023
********
Following the successful acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, Bobby Kotick has confirmed that he will continue as CEO until the end of 2023. In a letter addressed to the employees of the company, Kotick expressed his commitment to aiding in the forthcoming transition period and frequently mentioned the Head of Microsoft’s Gaming Division, Phil Spencer.

Kotick initially served as CEO of Activision from February 1991 until July 2008. Subsequently, he assumed the role of CEO at Activision Blizzard, a move that followed the merger between Activision and Vivendi Games. Given his substantial ownership stake in the company and the completion of the acquisition, he is poised to receive a substantial financial windfall, potentially totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. Additionally, his contract includes provisions for a severance payment in the event of contract termination or if he decides to depart within the first year following the acquisition.

News & Commentary: October 15, 2023 ✦ OnLabor
********
In this weekend’s news and commentary, California’s healthcare workers will have a $25 minimum wage; Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard nears completion and could lead to unionization; a report highlights recent organizing efforts at abortion services providers; and NLRB releases data on the past year’s ULP charges and election petitions.

On Friday, California’s governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill that will increase the minimum wage for most healthcare workers to $25 per hour by 2026. Advocates for the bill had described it as a necessary measure to help address the state’s healthcare worker shortage. The bill was contentious in California’s legislature. Many Democrats worried that rural community hospitals facing a significantly higher minimum wage would either collapse or pass on higher costs to patients. Lawmakers compromised by implementing a staggered rollout period. Large hospitals will be required to pay $23 per hour starting next year and $25 by 2026, while small rural providers and providers serving high rates of Medicare and Medi-Cal patients will start at $18 per hour and will reach $25 in 2033. Other compromises in the bill included a provision blocking cities and counties from raising wages locally, and a provision blocking attempts to cap hospital executive pay.

Next, on Friday Microsoft acquired the video game production company Activision Blizzard. Microsoft’s $69-billion purchase was announced more than a year ago but had received significant scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States. The deal could have significant implications for unionization at Activision. Last year, after Microsoft announced the merger, the CWA and Microsoft entered into a labor neutrality agreement: the CWA supported the merger and Microsoft committed to take a neutral approach to unionization at Activision if the merger went through. The neutrality provision will go into effect 60 days after the company’s purchase closes. According to the CWA, covered employees will be able to communicate with each other and with union representatives “in a way that encourages information sharing and avoids business disruptions.” Activision workers have engaged in high-profile protests in the past several years to highlight discrimination, sexual harassment, and pay inequity.

As Bloomberg News reports, at least eight reproductive health-care groups have organized since last year’s Supreme Court decision in Dobbs. Data collected by Bloomberg suggests that there has been an increase in organizing at these providers since the Court announced Dobbs. For example, of the twelve Planned Parenthood locations that are unionized, four voted to do so since Dobbs, including one in California with nearly 300 employees. Bloomberg suggested some possible explanations for an increase in organizing. First, many of the newly organized providers are in states have seen influxes of patients coming from states with abortion restrictions. The number of abortions provided in California in the first half of this year had increased 17% compared to the same period in 2020. One worker suggested that clinic workers are feeling overworked and the increased demands may have encouraged them to organize. Second, the healthcare industry has been a source of significant labor activity in the past year. Workers across the health care industry have struggled with staffing shortages, overwork, and low pay. According to one clinician at a Planned Parenthood location, these challenges exist in the reproductive services industry as well, and “working in abortion care and reproductive and sexual health care there are unique stressors as well.”

Finally, the NLRB released data about the past year that provides more evidence of increasing union activity. Bloomberg News analyzed the Board’s reported case data and reports that over 20,000 unfair labor practice charges were filed with the Board in the past year, a 10% jump from the previous year and the highest number of cases since 2016. Workers filed nearly 2,600 union representation petitions, the highest number since 2015. However, with its static staffing level, the Board has been unable to keep pace with the rise in incoming cases. Board Chair Lauren McFerran said that “additional resources are necessary to enable the board to expand staffing capacity and continue processing cases more efficiently.”

Xbox Mobile Store Reportedly Still Due In 2024
********
The Verge journalist Tom Warren made a guest appearance on the latest episode of the Iron Lords Podcast to discuss the aftermath of Microsoft's Xbox successful closure of the $68.7 billion merger with Activision Blizzard. Warren highlighted the importance of the mobile market in this deal, adding that Microsoft still aims to release an Xbox mobile store at some point next year.

For them, it's the control aspect of these games. Having them on Game Pass. I think a lot of this hasn't really been talked about because it's been overshadowed by the CMA stuff, the cloud stuff, is mobile. All that mobile stuff is huge.

I think obviously people who play on console and PC probably don't care as much, but mobile is making money, more money than consoles. That's going to be the key, I think.

It all ties in with Microsoft making an Xbox mobile store that could potentially launch next year, depending on some of the EU regulations that could open up the mobile stores. If all that stuff comes together, then having a good amount of mobile games that you're publishing is going to be super interesting.

We've seen Apple introducing games like Resident Evil Village and stuff to the iPhone 15 Pro. We're on the cusp where mobile might become a lot more interesting and have native games there, not just cloud.

It sounds like the Xbox mobile store is still on track for a 2024 launch. As you may recall, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer had first announced it as a strong possibility upon closure of the Activision Blizzard deal:

We want to be in a position to offer Xbox and content from both our third-party partners and us across any screen where somebody would want to play. Today, we can’t do that on mobile devices, but we want to build towards a world that we think will be coming where those devices are opened up. The Digital Markets Act that’s coming — those are the kinds of things that we are planning for. I think it’s a huge opportunity.

Earlier, Spencer said Activision Blizzard King's mobile strength was a key factor in the acquisition as Microsoft had concluded that gaming's business would be untenable without a strong position in the ever-growing mobile market.

Absolutely. In addition, the number that’s not in the Candy Crush/King number is Call of Duty: Mobile and Diablo mobile, which are big franchises that exist in that Activision and Blizzard bucket that are also major players on phones.

Activision/Blizzard/King are now in a position where they have great PC franchises, great console franchises, and great mobile franchises. The real differentiation that they add for Microsoft is their mobile capability.

Are you excited about the prospect of an Xbox mobile store coming up in 2024?
