Gaming News Roundup: Xbox Showcase, WoW Class Revealed, New Dragon Ball Series, and Free Diablo 4!

Welcome to the latest gaming news segment. Today, we have some exciting updates from the world of Xbox.

First up, Microsoft has announced an Xbox Partner Preview showcase set to take place on Wednesday, October 25. This livestream event will feature upcoming games from third-party developers, including highly anticipated titles like Alan Wake 2, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and ARK: Survival Ascended. The showcase will be streamed on Xbox's YouTube and Twitch channels, and will provide over 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage.

While fans are eager to hear more about the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, the announcement clarifies that the Xbox Partner Preview will not include any news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related to the acquisition. However, it will offer a refreshing mix of indie games and familiar favorites from third-party partners, such as Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, and Studio Wildcard.

In other news, World of Warcraft Classic developer Blizzard has revealed the worst class to play as, and it's bad news for Hunters. According to statistics provided by Blizzard, the Hunter class has the highest death percentage of any class in the UK, with a staggering 41% of players choosing this class meeting their permanent demise. Blizzard warns players not to underestimate the dangers that Hunters may face, as they may not be as safe as they seem. The statistics also reveal the most deadly locations in the game, with Teldrassil, Undercity, and Stormwind causing the most deaths among players. Additionally, the deadliest level for players is Level 6, with 10% of players not surviving past this point.

Moving on, Diablo 4 is offering a free-to-play weekend for Xbox players. This is a great opportunity to try out the game before deciding whether to make a purchase. The free period started yesterday and will continue until October 22, 11:59 PM Pacific Time. Players can enjoy up to 10 hours of gameplay during this time. Those who decide to purchase the game can take advantage of discounted prices on different editions of Diablo 4.

The game's Season 2 content, Season of Blood, will not be accessible during the trial period, but players can still experience the main campaign. Season 2 brings several updates, including crossplay and cross-progression fixes.
