Navigating the Market: Analyzing the Fed, Apple, and Eli Lilly

CNBC's Jim Cramer will be focusing on two central events in the coming week - the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and earnings reports from companies such as Eli Lilly and Apple. Cramer expressed concerns about the recent "brutal" days in the stock market and the impact of the bond market on stocks.

On Monday, Cramer will be watching for the results of McDonald's earnings report. Tuesday, he will be keeping an eye on quarterly reports from Caterpillar, Amgen, Eaton, and Advanced Micro Devices. Cramer expects Caterpillar to report a decent quarter due to federal infrastructure funding supporting the industrial sector.

Wednesday is an important day as Cramer eagerly awaits the Federal Reserve's meeting. He will also be looking at CVS's report and the report from Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut.

Cramer calls Thursday the most important business day of the week, with earnings from Eli Lilly and Apple. He believes Eli Lilly's Mounjaro could be a success, and he reaffirms his belief in owning Apple, not trading it, despite potential bad publicity around its quarterly report.

In addition to these events, Cramer expresses concerns about the bond market, stating that unless there is relief, everything he just described is merely a trade.

While the Federal Reserve meeting is typically the stock-market story of the week, this time investors are more focused on Apple's earnings report than the central bank's interest-rate decision. Concerns about Apple include a slump in smartphone sales and investigations into one of its main suppliers in China. A revenue decline is expected for the fourth consecutive quarter, the longest streak in over two decades. The stock has already been struggling and has lost about $460 billion in market value.

The performance of big tech companies, including Apple, has been influential in stock market movements recently. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Index have both declined about 10% from their July peaks. The earnings reports from several major tech companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have driven these declines after powering the surge in stocks through July.

Despite the focus on Apple, the Federal Reserve decision is still important. Traders expect rates to be held steady but will listen carefully to Chair Jerome Powell's remarks afterward for hints on the path forward and the economic outlook.

Other significant events driving global risk include the escalation of the war in the Gaza strip and the US Treasury's announcement of plans for selling bonds and notes to refinance the government's debt. Any ramp up in sales could send yields soaring again, impacting growth stocks.

Investors are concerned about the reliance on big tech companies for stock market gains this year and are unsure where gains will come from if these stocks continue to struggle. The reactions to earnings reports from these companies indicate that stocks are priced for perfection, and any signs of weakness lead to selling.

In summary, the focus in the coming week will be on the Federal Reserve meeting and earnings reports from companies like Eli Lilly and Apple. There are concerns about the stock market's recent performance and the impact of the bond market on stocks. Investors are also watching for any signs of weakness in big tech companies, particularly Apple, which has been facing challenges in smartphone sales.
