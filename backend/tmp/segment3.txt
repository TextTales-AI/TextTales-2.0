Lionel Messi's Journey: From MLS Newcomer of the Year to the Paris 2024 Olympics.

In this segment, we will be discussing the latest developments surrounding Lionel Messi and his impact on Major League Soccer (MLS).

First, Messi has been named a finalist for MLS Newcomer of the Year. This comes as no surprise, as Messi has been sensational since joining Inter Miami CF this summer. He has scored 11 goals and provided eight assists, making a significant impact on the team.

The other finalists for the award are Giorgos Giakoumakis of Atlanta United and Eduard Löwen of St. Louis City SC. The winner will be announced during the MLS Cup Playoffs.

In addition to being a Newcomer of the Year finalist, Messi is also in contention for the MLS Most Valuable Player award. The finalists for this prestigious award are Luciano "Lucho" Acosta of FC Cincinnati, Thiago Almada of Atlanta United, and Dénis Bouanga of Los Angeles Football Club. The MVP winner will also be announced during the MLS Cup Playoffs.

Moving on, Messi's presence has had a profound impact on his Inter Miami teammates. One of his teammates, DeAndre Yedlin, expressed his admiration for Messi, saying he was starstruck upon meeting him. However, Yedlin also noted that Messi is a very humble and down-to-earth person.

Messi's humility and extraordinary talent have earned him multiple accolades throughout his career. In fact, he is expected to win the Ballon d'Or for the eighth time, further solidifying his status as one of the greatest players in the world. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola even suggested that there should be a separate Ballon d'Or award for Messi and one for the rest of the players.

Looking ahead, Inter Miami is preparing for the 2024 season. Despite missing out on the MLS playoffs this year, the team is determined to achieve success in the upcoming season. The addition of new stars like Messi, Jordi Alba, and Sergio Busquets, as well as coach Gerardo "Tata" Martino, has brought a renewed sense of optimism to the club.

Inter Miami will be aiming to compete for multiple trophies, including the MLS Cup, Leagues Cup, U.S. Open Cup, and CONCACAF Champions Cup. The team is aware of the challenges ahead but remains optimistic about their chances.

However, there have been some recent developments regarding Inter Miami's planned trip to China for exhibition matches. The trip has been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. The tour promoter, NSN, cited respect for Chinese officials following the death of the country's former second-ranking leader, Li Keqiang. It would have been Messi's eighth time playing in China, and the total attendance for the two matches was expected to exceed 100,000.

Despite this setback, Inter Miami remains committed to expanding its global reach and exploring future opportunities for international tours.

Finally, there is speculation that Messi may participate in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. The International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, hopes to see Messi represent Argentina and compete for an Olympic gold medal. If Messi were to win gold in Paris, he would become the only football player in history to have won two Olympic gold medals and a World Cup.

Overall, Messi's impact in MLS has been significant, both on and off the pitch. His presence has elevated the level of play and brought increased attention to the league. Fans and teammates alike admire his talent and humility, and he continues to be recognized as one of the greatest footballers of all time.
